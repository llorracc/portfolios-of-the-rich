Carroll}\medskip\vspace{1in}\centerline{Abstract}Recent research has shown that `rich' households save at much higher rates than others (see Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave}; Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes~\cite{dsz:richsave}; Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave}; Huggett~\cite{huggett:wealth}; Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship}).  This paper documents another large difference between the rich and the rest of the population: portfolios of the rich are heavily skewed toward investments in their own privately held businesses.  The paper explores three possible explanations.  First, perhaps there is exogenous variation in risk tolerance which leads highly risk tolerant households to engage in high-risk, high-return activities, and the risk-lovers who are lucky end up rich.  A second possibility is that capital market imperfections {\it a la} Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave} and Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} require entrepreneurial activities to be largely self-financed, and these same imperfections imply that entreprenurial investiment will yield high average returns.  The final possibility is that wealth enters households' utility functions directly as a luxury good as in Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} (one interpretation is that this reflects the utility of anticipated bequests).  A consequence of that model which was not anticipated in the original paper is its implication that household preferences exhibit decreasing relative risk aversion, which could explain why rich households are much more likely to engage in high-risk high-return entrepreneurial activities even without capital market imperfections or taste differences.  The paper concludes that the overall pattern of facts suggests both Carroll-style utility and Gentry/Hubbard-Quadrini style capital market imperfections are important.\ifthenelse{\boolean{TilburgVersion}}{ }{This paper presents data on the portfolio structure of rich households and of typical households, and compares the results to the predictions of a dynamic stochastic optimization model of household portfolio choice which nests the two hypotheses about the reasons for the higher saving rate of the rich.  The results lead to three main conclusions: 1) the ability of some `entrepreneurial' households to earn a higher rate of return on their investments is not sufficient by itself to explain the patterns in the data, because that model implies that even consumers who can earn a high rate of return will try to consume all of their wealth before they die, and there is no evidence of decumulation at old ages by the very rich; 2) the heterogeneity in saving rates at different levels of permanent income induced by assuming that bequests are luxury goods is also insufficient, taken alone, to generate the degree of wealth concentration observed at the top of the distribution, because the rates of return on publicly traded assets are not high enough to generate the extraordinary concentrations of wealth observed at the very top of the wealth distribution; 3) a model which combines the two assumptions is consistent with the data, because the high rate of return on entrepreneurial investments allows the accumulation of massive amounts of wealth while the `luxury' nature of bequests implies there is no reason to decumulate that wealth before death.}\vfill\eject\clearpage\clearpage\noindent {\sc Reporter, to bank robber Willie Sutton:} \newline\indent	``Mr. Sutton, why do you rob banks?''\noindent {\sc Willie Sutton:} \newline\indent ``That's where the money is!''\section{Introduction}If Willie Sutton had been an economist interested in portfolio behavior, he would not have been very interested in the median household.  Ever since the pathbreaking work of Pareto more than a century ago, economists have known that wealth is extremely unevenly distributed.  And more recently, survey data have revealed that the portfolio of financial and real assets of the median household (at least in the U.S.) is rather simple: a checking/savings account plus a home and mortgage, and not much else.\footnote{Bertaut and Starr-McCluer~\cite{b&s-m:usportfolios} find that the only kind of financial asset held by more than half of US households is a checking account.} Overwhelmingly, the data tell us that if we wish to understand aggregate portfolio behavior, it is critical to understand the behavior of the richest few percent of households, both because they control the bulk of aggregate wealth and because their portfolio behavior is much more complex than that of the typical household.Despite the strength of these arguments, there seems to have been little recent academic work directed at understanding the portfolio behavior of wealthy households.  The goal of this paper is to provide a summary of the basic facts (and how the facts have changed over time) in a form which allows comparison of the behavior of the rich both with the behavior of the rest of the population in the U.S. and with portfolio behavior among other groups and other countries surveyed in this volume, and to make a preliminary attempt to discern the characteristics that will be required of any model which hopes to be consistent with the full range of observed behavior.The principal conclusion from the empirical work will be that the most important way in which the portfolios of the rich differfrom those of the rest is that they are heavily weighted towardinvestments in privately held entrepreneurial ventures.  This is particularly true of the rich who became rich without havinginherited a substantial amount of wealth.After the empirical conclusions are presented, the paper informally considers how these results related to the academic literature on theoretical models of portfolio behavior.  The starting point for the theoretical analysis will be a standard stochastic version of the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis model.  That model will prove inadequate, however, because it implies that the rich should look like scaled-up versions of everybody else.  They should neither have disproportionate wealth-to-income ratios, nor have particularly unusual portfolio structures.The gist of the theoretical discussion will be to consider whether any of three potential modifications to the standard model might explain the observed combination of facts.  The first idea is that perhaps there is exogenous variation in risk aversion across households.  In that case more risk-tolerant households would take greater risks and on average would earn higher returns.  If owning a private business is the form of economic activity that offers the highest risk and highest return, the most risk tolerant households would gravitate toward entrepreneurship, and on average would end up richer.  The paper will argue that a defect of this story is that, taken alone, it provides no explanation for the strong positive empirical relationship between {\it ex ante} wealth and the propensity to begin entrepreneurial ventures.  Nor, in the absence of capital market imperfections, does it explain why the risk-lovers would feel the need to invest in {\it their own} entrepreneurial ventures.The latter point leads to the second possibility: that the observed patterns are simply a consequence of capital market imperfections, as argued recently by Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave} and Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship}.  Those authors argue that adverse selection and moral hazard problems require entrepreneurial enterprises to be largely self-financed.  They further assume that there is a minimum efficient scale for private enterprises and that this minimum scale is large relative to the wealth of the typical household.  The combination of these two assumptions can explain why households with low or moderate wealth do not often become entrepreneurs.  Furthermore, this story requires no differences in tastes among members of the population, and in principle can explain both the high saving rates of the rich and the high portfolio shares they hold in their own entrepreneurial ventures.  However, a problem with this story is that, if the standard model's assumption about household preferences is not changed, even the model with imperfect capital markets implies that as the rich get old, they eventually begin running down their wealth.  In contrast, empirical data reveal no evidence that wealthy elderly households eventually begin to run down their wealth.The final possibility considered is that the model's assumption about the household utility function needs to be changed in a manner similar to that proposed by Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave}, who simply assumes that wealth enters the utility function as a luxury good in a modified Stone-Geary form.  Since Max Weber~\cite{weber:capitalism} argued that a love of wealth for itself is the spirit of capitalism, Bakshi and Chen~\cite{bakshi&chen:spirit} and Zou~\cite{zou:spirit} have dubbed models of this class `capitalist spirit' models.  Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} proposed this modification to the standard model as a way to explain the high lifetime saving rates of the rich, and one interpretation of the utility of wealth was that it represented a `joy of giving' bequest motive.  It turns out, however, that an unanticipated consequence of the model is that it implies decreasing relative risk aversion, which in turn can explain why the rich hold riskier portfolios than the rest of the population.  The paper concludes that the main features of the data can probably be explained in a model which combines capital market imperfections of the kind emphasized by Gentry and Hubbard and Quadrini with a utility function like that postulated in Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave}.\section{The Data}\subsection{Portfolios of the Rich}U.S. survey data on the portfolios of the rich are the best in the world.  The 1962-63 {\it Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers} (henceforth SFCC) was the first wealth survey to heavily oversample the richest households.  The next comprehensive wealth survey was the 1983 {\it Survey of Consumer Finances}, which was followed by a 1989 SCF which consisted of a subsample of reinterviewed households from the 1983 survey along with a fresh batch of new households.  Since 1989 the SCF has been performed triennially (though with no further panel elements), with the latest survey having been completed in 1998 (we hope to have data from the 1998 survey in time for the final draft of this paper).The availability of data spanning such a long time period opens up the possibility of studing how portfolios change in response to changes in the economic enviornment.  Before presenting the data on portfolio structure, therefore, we first present a summary of the taxation and legal changes that we might expect to have had a substantial impact on portfolio structure of the rich.\subsubsection{The Tax Environment}Table \ref{table:laws} summarizes the changes over time in the three aspects of taxes that are particularly important to the rich.  (For information on broader changes in the tax code see the paper in this volume by Poterba).  The first two columns show the statutory top marginal federal tax rate, which declined from 91 percent in 1963 to 39.6 percent in 1993 and thereafter.  The second column shows the actual proportion of their incomes that were paid in taxes by the richest one percent of households.  In contrast to the dramatic decline in top marginal rates, the proportion of their incomes that the rich actually paid in taxes has been remarkably steady, varying between around 20 and 25 percent over the entire period.  This reflects the fact that during the era of high top marginal rates, the tax code was riddled with tax shelters and loopholes that made it possible for almost all rich people to avoid paying the confiscatory top marginal rates that were on the statute books.The estate tax is also highly relevant for the rich.  The structure of the estate tax is rather complex, but that structure remained largely the same over the period in question.  The structure is as follows.  The first \$x of an estate is free from estate taxation altogether, where \$x is indicated by the column of the table labelled `exemption.'  Above \$x, the tax rate begins at a marginal rate of $y$ percent and peaks at a top marginal rate of $z$ percent, where $y$ and $z$ are the first and second numbers in the column labelled `tax range.'  The exclusion for closely held businesses is essentially a mechanism that reduces the amount of the value of a closely-held business that is taxable, under the condition that the heir plans to `actively mange' the business rather than sell it.  The marital deduction indicates how much of the estate is taxed when it is transferred to a spouse.  The 100 percent deduction since 1985 essentially means that estates are taxed only when both members of a married couple have died.The final kind of tax that is relevant to the rich is the gift tax exclusion amount \$g, whose value is reported in the last column of the table.  This is the amount that each member of the household (husband and wife) can give to any individual (son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, etc) annually without incurring any additional taxes for the recipient or donor.The table shows that there have been two big changes in the taxes specifically relevant for the rich over the period in question: the large increase exemption levels for the estate tax in the early 1980s, and the more gradual, but cumulatively very large, decline in top marginal rates.\subsubsection{Detailed Portfolio Structure}Our statistical summary of the portfolio structure of the rich begins with Table \ref{table:pctown}, which provides data on the proportion of the rich (defined here and henceforth as the top one percent of households by net worth) who own any amount of various kinds of assets.Perhaps the most dramatic change over time in the table is the sharp increase in the proportion of households with defined contribution pension plans.  In the 1962-63 SFCC, only 12.5 percent of the rich had any such account, but by 1983 the fraction had already jumped to 65.6, while by 1995 the fraction had reached 78.6 percent.  The low percentage in 1962-63 is attributable to the fact that there was little tax advantage to such plans until the early 1980s, when 401(k)s and IRAs suddenly were made available in principle to the whole population.  What is interesting is the speed with which rich households availed themselves of these new options.  Bertaut and Starr-McCluer~\cite{b&s-m:usportfolios} show (Table 3) that only 31 percent of all households had acquired such accounts by the time of the 1983 survey.Another notable change is that the proportion holding individual stock shares directly has fallen from 83.2 percent in 1962 to 65.0 percent in 1995, while the proportion holding mutual funds has risen from about 25 percent to about 45 percent.  This likely reflects a broad pattern in which households have increasingly decided to hold shares in the form of mutual funds rather than individual stocks.  This pattern has not been much studied by economists, although it is interesting because it reflects a convergence of actual behavior toward the recommendation of portfolio theory for diversification.Among the other categories of assets, the largest changes are seen in the holdings of `other bonds' (primarily corporate bonds), which declined very sharply between 1962 and 1983 and fluctuated substantially between 1983 and 1995.  There is no obvious tax reason for these fluctuations.The proportion of the richest households who have equity in a privately held business has fluctuated substantially over the years, from a low of 66.5 percent in 1962-63 to a high of 88.0 percent in 1983.With respect to debt holdings, the proportion of rich households with any debt jumped sharply between the SFCC, when it was 52.4 percent, and the 1983 SCF, when it was 77.9 percent, but exhibited no clear trend thereafter.  Among debt categories, the most striking change is the increase in the proportion of households with mortgage debt, from 31.9 percent in 1962 to 52.5 percent in 1995.  This likely reflects the fact that mortgage interest remained tax deductible while other forms of debt lost their deductible status in the 1986 tax reform.On the whole, the striking feature of this table is that the proportion of rich households owning various categories of assets has not changed greatly for most categories of assets - particularly considering that small sample sizes mean that there is inevitably some measurement error in the statistics for any particular year.\footnote{ One exception is `other financial assets,' which had an 88.8 percent owernship rate in the 1962-63 SFCC but much lower rates in the later surveys.  This is almost certainly because holdings of cash were included in this grab-bag category in the SFCC but not in the SCF's.  In any case, the next table shows that `other finanical assets' constitute a trivial proportion of net worth in all surveys.}Another useful comparison is of the rich to the rest of the population.  Average values for ownership shares for the nonrich over the five survey years are presented in the last column of the table.  The broadest observation that can be made here is that rich households are more likely to own virtually every kind of asset in every time period.  Particularly striking is the discrepancy in the proportion owning equity in a privately held business, which averages about 75 percent for the rich but only 13 percent for the rest of the population.  The contrast in ownership of shares in publiclytraded companies is only slightly less dramatic: 74 percentversus 16 percent.Table \ref{table:compnw} examines the relative weight of various kinds of assets in the net worth of the richest households.  The table shows that the shift from stocks to mutual funds was substantial, but even at the end of the sample in 1995, total net worth in individual shares remained substantially greater than that in mutual funds.  One of the largest shifts over time is in the role of investment real estate, which jumps from 7.4 percent of net worth in 1962-63 to over 20 percent in 1983.  Investment real estate continues to constitute more than 20 percent of the portfolio until 1995, when its share drops to 13.1 percent.  The jump in investment real estate between the early 1960s and the early 1980s may reflect the prominent role of real estate in tax shelters until the tax reform act of 1986.  One would have expected a decline in investment real estate following the repeal of many of these tax shelters in the 1986 tax act, so it is surprising that no decline is manifest until 1995.Another interesting observations from the table is the small size of mortgage debt (only 1.1 percent of net worth on average) despite the fact that more than half of the rich have positive amounts of mortgage debt.Comparing the rich to the rest of the population, again perhaps themost important difference is the importance of business equity for therich.  Such wealth accounts for about 40 percent of total net worth of the rich in 1983 and thereafter, vastly more than its share in the net worth of the typical household.  Other differences includethe lower total indebtedness of the rich and the much smaller proportion of total wealth tied up in home equity.\subsubsection{Portfolio Structure And Portfolio Theory}The usual theoretical analysis of portfolio allocation considers the optimal proportion of net worth to invest in `risky' versus `safe' assets.  This stylized theoretical treatment is conceptually useful but difficult to bring to data, because it is hard to allocate every asset to one of these two categories.  Table~\ref{table:riskysafe} reflects an effort to find a compromise between the complexity of actual portfolios and the simplicity of theory.Among financial assets, there are some that are clearly safe (like checking, saving, and money-market accounts) and some that are clearly risky (like stock shares).  But other assets are harder to allocate, either because the item itself has an ambiguous status (like long-term government bonds, which are subject to inflation risk but not repayment risk (we hope!)) or because the asset is a composite with unknown proportions of risky and safe assets (like mutual funds which hold both stocks and government bonds).  We have therefore allocated all financial assets to one of four categories: Clearly safe, probably safe, clearly risky, and probably risky, which can of course be further aggregated into broad measures of safe and risky assets.  Finally, we report unsecured debt separately because theory does not give much guidance about whether to subtract it from the `safe' or `risky' category.We have divided nonfinancial assets into the primary residence, investment real estate, vehicles, and `other.'  Because equity in privately held business is substantially different from other kinds of investments, it merits its own category.With these definitions, we can construct three definitions of risky assets: A `narrow' definition, which includes only financial assets which are rated as clearly risky; a `broad' definition, which includes clearly and probably risky financial assets, business equity, and investment real estate; and a `broadest' definition which adds even the `probably safe' assets.It is apparent from the table that the rich bear dramatically more risk than the rest of the population.  In all five surveys the proportion of their portfolios that consisted of broadly risky assets was about 75 percent or greater, compared with an average percentage of only 40 for the nonrich households.  Examining the data in more detail reveals two key differences between the rich and the rest: the rich hold a much smaller proportion of their wealth in home equity (6 percent versus 34 percent) and a much larger proportion in business equity and investment real estate (the sum of these two categoriesis 52.1 percent for the rich versus 26.2 percent for the rest).Another perspective on the portfolios of the rich is presented in Table \ref{table:diversification}, which provides a census of the portfolio structure of the rich along the four dimensions corresponding to ownership or non-ownership of clearly safe, probably safe, clearly risky, and probably risky assets, a total of $4^{2}=16$ different possibilities.  In all five survey years, a majority or nearly a majority of the rich held some assets in each of these four categories.  This is a sharp contrast to the behavior of the rest of the population, which is much more evenly distributed among the 16 categories but is most heavily concentrated in the region with only safe assets.  (See Bertaut and Starr-McCluer for the data on therest of the population.)Finally, Table \ref{table:riskbyage} presents data on ownership rates for risky assets by age of the household head for each of the survey years.\footnote{The high ownership rates for risky assets in the 1962 SFCC are an error; we accidentally included `other financial assets' in the risky category, which is inappropriate because we believe that most of the content of `other financial assets' is holdings of cash.  This will be fixed in a future version of the paper.} Interestingly, the patterns for ownership rates and for portfolio shares are different: The probability of owning at least some amount of risky assets is monotonically increasing in age, but the {\it proportion} of the portfolio composed of `broad risky' assets rises through the first three age categories (up to age 49) but falls for the 50-59 age group.  Ownership rates of `risky' assets show a similar monotonic increase (at least until age 70+), while the portfolio share shows no clear rise with age but again does display a decline in the 50-59 age group.  As King and Leape~\cite{king&leape:ageinfo} argue, the monotonic increase in ownership rates may reflect the accumulation of experience with different assets as the household ages.  The reduction in the risky share of the portfolio is interesting because it corresponds roughly to the common financial advice to shift assets away from risky forms as retirement approaches.\footnote{It is important to recall, however, that these figures may reflect the effects of both cohort and time effects as well as age effects, so the true age effects may differ.} \section{Analysis}Thus far we have presented data with little effort to understand the underlying behavior which gives rise to these data.  It is now time to begin trying to understand these underlying behavioral patterns.We start by presenting a baseline formal model of saving over the life cycle.\subsection{The Basic Stochastic Life Cycle Model}The following model is what I will characterize as the basic stochastic life cycle model.  The consumer's goal is to solve the problem\begin{eqnarray*}	\max &  & \sum_{s=t}^{T} \beta^{s-t} \mathcal{D}_{t,s} u(C_{t})  \label{eq:maxutil} \\\end{eqnarray*}where $u(C)$ is a constant relative risk aversion utility function $u(C)=c^{1-\rho}/(1-\rho)$, $\beta$ is the (constant) geometric discount factor, and $\mathcal{D}_{t,s} = \prod_{h=t}^{s-1}(1-d_{h})$ is the probability that the consumer will not die between periods $t$ and $s$ ($\mathcal{D}_{t,t}$ is defined to be 1; $d_{t}$ is the probability of death between period $t$ and $t+1$).The maximization is of course subject to constraints.  In particular, if, following Deaton~\cite{deatonLiqConstrs}, we define $X_{t}$ as `cash-on-hand' at time $t$, the sum of wealth and current income, then the consumer faces a budget constraint of the form\begin{eqnarray*}	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1}\end{eqnarray*}where $S_{t} = X_{t}-C_{t}$ is the portion of last period's resources the consumer did not spend, $R_{t+1}$ is the gross rate of return earned between $t$ and $t+1$, and $Y_{t+1}$ is the noncapital income the consumer earns in period $t+1$.Assume that the consumer's noncapital income in each period is given by their permanent income $P_{t}$ mutiplied by a mean-one transitory shock, $E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+1}] = 1$, and assume that permanent income grows at rate $G_{t}$ between periods, but is also buffeted by a mean-one shock, $P_{t+1} = G_{t+1}P_{t}\eta_{t+1}$ such that $E_{t} [\eta_{t+1}]=1$.Given these assumptions, the consumer's choices are influenced byonly two state variables at a given point in time: the level of the consumer's assets $X_{t}$ and the level of permanent income, $P_{t}$.As usual, the problem can be rewritten in recursive form with a valuefunction $V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t})$.  Written out fully in this form,the consumer's problem is\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta \mathcal{D}_{t,t+1} E_{t}\left[V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1}) \right] \nonumber\\ 	 & \mbox{such that} &   	\label{eq:bellmanstd}  \\	S_{t}   & = & X_{t}-C_{t} \nonumber \\	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1} \nonumber \\	Y_{t+1} & = & P_{t+1}\epsilon_{t+1} \nonumber \\	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \eta_{t+1} \nonumber \\\end{eqnarray}\subsection{The Saving Behavior of the Rich}Within the last decade, advances in computer speed and numerical methods have finally allowed economists to solve life cycle consumption/saving problems like that presented above with serious uncertainty and realistic utility (see, in particular, Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes~\cite{hsz:importance}; Huggett~\cite{huggett:wealth}; Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih}; and the references therein).  I have argued elsewhere (Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih}) that the implications of these models fit the available evidence on the consumption/saving behavior of the typical household reasonably well, certainly much better than the old Certainty Equivalent (CEQ) models did.However, another finding from this line of research has been that themodel is unable to account for the very high concentrations of wealthat the top of the distribution.  \subsubsection{How Rich Are They?}Very.Figure~\ref{fig:Top1pctWProfilePatientvsSCF} shows the ratio of wealth to `permanent' income\footnote{SCF respondents are asked whether their total income this year was above normal, about normal, or below normal.  Following Friedman~\cite{friedmanATheory}, I define permanent income as the level of income the household would normally receive.} by age for the population as a whole and for the households in the richest one percent by age category from the 1992 and 1995 SCFs.  Also plotted for comparison is the level of the wealth to income ratio at the top 1 percent implied by a standard life cycle model of saving similar to that in Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih} or Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes~\cite{hsz:importance}.  (Specifically, it is the Carroll model with HSZ `baseline' parameter values).  The richest one percent are much richer than implied by the life cycle model.  In addition, the figure plots the age profile of the 99th percentile that would be implied by the HSZ model if it were assumed that consumers do not discount future utility at all.  The figure shows that even with such patient consumers, the model remains far short of predicting the observed wealth to income ratios at the 99th percentile.\footnote{This figure is reproduced from Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave}.}  This finding is reconfirmed in a recent paper by Engen, Gale, and Uccello~\cite{egu:adequacy}, who do a very careful job of modelling pension arrangements, tax issues, and other institutional details neglected in the exercise above and also find that the wealth-to-income ratios at the top part of the income distribution are much greater than predicted by a life cycle dynamic stochastic optimization model, even with a time preference rate of zero.\subsubsection{How Do They Spend It All?}They don't.  In the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs, households were asked whether their spending usually exceeds their income, and whether their spending exceeded their income in the previous year.  In order to run down their wealth, obviously households obviously must spend more than their income.  Yet only five percent of the rich elderly households in the SCF answered that their spending usually exceeded their income.More evidence is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:OldRichDontDissave}, which shows the levels of wealth by age for the elderly in the 1992 and 1995 SCFs.  There is no evidence in this figure that wealth is declining for this population; indeed, if anything it seems to be increasing.\footnote{This is in effect a smoothed profile of wealth by age adjusted for cohort effects; see Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} for methodological details.} This is consistent with the answers that the rich elderly give to such questions as whether they have spent more than their income in the previous year or whether they usually spend more than their incomes.  Virtually none of the rich report spending more than their incomes, either in the previous year or on a regular basis.The implication is that most of the wealth which we observe them holding will still be around at death.  This is obviously aproblem for any model in which the only purpose in saving is to provide for one's own future consumption.  This crude evidence is backed up by a study by Auten and Joulfaian~\cite{auten&joulfaian:charitable} which finds that the elasticity of bequests with respect to lifetime resources is well in excess of one (their point estimate is 1.3).  See Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} for a summary of further evidence that, far from spending their wealth down, the rich elderly continue to save.\subsection{Adding Portfolio Choice}Recently, a wave of papers (Haliassos and Bertaut~\cite{haliassos&bertaut:fewholdstocks}, Fratantoni~\cite{fratantoni:equitypremium},Gakidis~\cite{gakidis:stocksforold}; Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout~\cite{cgm:lcportfolio}; and Hochgurtel~\cite{hochgurtel:bufferportfolio}) has examined the predictions of these kinds of models when consumers facing labor income risk are allowed to choose freely between investing in a low-return safe asset like the one considered in the earlier models and investing in risky assets parameterized to resemble the returns yielded by equity investments in the past.The only modification to the formal optimization problem presented above necessary to allow portfolio choice is to designate $R_{t+1}$ as the portfolio-weighted return, which will depend on the proportion of the portfolio that is allocated to the safe and the risky assets, and on the rate of return on the risky asset between $t$ and $t+1$.  Call the proportion of the portfolio invested in the risky asset (`stocks') $w_{s,t}$ (where $w$ is mnemonic for the portfolio `weight'), and $(1-w_{s,t})$ is the portion invested in the safe asset.  If the return on stocks between $t$ and $t+1$ is $R_{s,t+1}$, the portfolio-weighted return on the consumer's savings will be $R(1-w_{s,t})+R_{s,t}w_{s,t}$.However, even without solving a model of this type formally, it is clear that such models will not be able to explain the empirical differences between the portfolio behavior of the rich and the behavior of the rest of the population, because when the utilityfunction is in the CRRA class problems of this type are homothetic.That is, there is no systematic difference in the behavior of consumers at different levels of lifetime permanent income.  Hence, such models provide no means to explain the very largedifferences in saving and portfolio behavior documented above.\subsection{Three Possible Modifications}There are at least three ways one might consider modifying the model in hopes that the modified model might be able to explain the nonhomotheticity of behavior.\subsubsection{Heterogeneity in Risk Tolerance}The first is simply to allow for heterogeneity in risk toleranceacross members of the population.  Formally, rather than assumingthat all consumers have the same value of $\rho$, the coefficientof relative risk aversion, we can assume that each consumer has an idiosyncratic, specific $\rho_{i}$.  The effect of this would be to allow consumers with low values of $\rho$ (high risk tolerance) to choose highly risky but high-return portfolios.  On average, the risk-tolerant consumers would be rewarded with higher returns and would therefore end up richer than the rest of the population.  Thus, the rich would be disproportionately rich-lovers, and would therefore have riskier portfolios than the rest.  As shorthand, I will call this the `preference heterogeneity'story henceforth.\subsubsection{Capital Market Imperfections}A second possibility is to follow Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave} and Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} in assuming that there are important imperfections in capital markets which 1) require entrepreneurial investment to be largely self-financed; 2) imply that entrepreneurial investment has a higher return than investments made on open capital markets; and 3) require a large minimum scale of investment.  As those authors show, the combination of these three assumptions can yield an implication that portfolios of higher wealth or higher income consumers will be much more heavily weighted toward entrepreneurial investments, and that rich consumers withbusiness equity have higher than average saving rates (because of the high returns that are available to them).  I will referto this theory as the `capital market imperfections' story.\subsubsection{Bequests as a Luxury Good}A final possibility is to change the assumption about the lifetime utility function.  Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} proposes adding a bequest motive of the form $B(S)$ takes a modified Stone-Geary form,\begin{eqnarray*}B(S) &= &\frac{(S + \gamma)^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha}.\end{eqnarray*}Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} shows that if one assumes that $\alpha<\rho$ then wealth will be a `luxury good' in the sense that as lifetime resources rise, a larger proportion of those resources is devoted to $S_{T}$.  In the limit as lifetime resources approach infinity, the proportion of resources devoted to the bequest approaches 1.  The other salient feature of the model is that if $\lambda > 0$ there will be a `cutoff' level of lifetime resources such that consumers poorer than the cutoff will leave no bequest at all.  Thus the model is capable of matching the crude stylized fact that low-income people tend to leave little or no bequests, and also captures the fact (from Auten and Joulfaian~\cite{auten&joulfaian:charitable}) that among those who leave bequests, the elasticity of lifetime bequests with respect to lifetime income is greater than one.In this paper the assumption is that one receives utility from the contemplation of the potential bequest in proportion to the probability that death (and the bequest) will occur.  Thus Bellman's equation would be modified to:\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta (1-d_{t}) E_{t}\left[V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1}) \right] + d_{t} B(S_{t})\nonumber\\ \end{eqnarray}and the transition equations for the state variables are unchanged.While it is obvious how this model might help to explain the high saving rates of the rich, it is not so obvious why it might help explain the high degree of riskiniess of their portfolios.  It turns out, however, that precisely the same assumption which implies that bequests are a luxury good {\it also implies that people are less risk-averse with respect to gambles over bequests than with respect to gambles over consumption.}  That assumption is that the exponenton the utility from bequests function $\alpha$ must be less thanthe exponent on the utility from consumption $\rho$.  This impliesthat the marginal utility from bequests declines more slowly thanthe marginal utility from consumption and thus as wealth rises moreand more of it is devoted to bequests rather than consumption.However, the traditional interpretation of exponents like $\rho$and $\alpha$ in utility functions of this class is as coefficientsof relative risk aversion, so the implication of less risk aversionwith respect to bequest gambles than consumption gambles is an immediate implication of the assumption that bequests are a luxury good!Max Weber~\cite{weber:capitalism} argued that the `spirit of capitalism' was the pursuit of wealth for its own sake.  Following Max Weber~\cite{weber:capitalism} as interpreted by Zou~\cite{zou:spirit} and Bakshi and Chen~\cite{bakshi&chen:spirit}, I call this the ``Capitalist Spirit'' model.\subsection{Distinguishing the Three Models}The princial unfinished empirical work of this paper is to provideempirical evidence which can distinguish between the three theoriesoutlined above, all of which can explain the basic facts that theportfolios of the rich are riskier than those of the rest and thatinvestment in closely-held businesses are a disproportionate share of the portfolios of the rich.Beginning with the heterogeneous preferences theory, it is useful to flesh out some of its implicit assumptions.  In order to explain the disproportionate share of business equity in the portfolios of the richest households, it is necessary to assume that business investments bear the highest risk and the highest return among the categories of assets summarized in the tables.  This assumption is plausible and therefore not problematic.  What {\it is} problematic for a theory based purely on preference heterogeneity is the tendency of the rich to invest mainly in {\it their own} entrepreneurial ventures.  We do not have a table demonstrating this point yet (there will be one in the next version), but from examining the raw data it is clear that the great majority of the wealth in closely-held businesses is in businesses in which the household has an `active management role' to use the terms of the survey.This may not be surprising intuitively either, but upon reflection it is clear that it implies some form of capital market imperfection.  If there were no such imperfections, the optimal strategy would be to hold only a tiny share in one's own entrepreneurial venture and similarly small shares in everyone else's entrepreneurial ventures in order to diversify the idiosyncratic risk.  Thus the preference heterogeneity story alone cannot explain the pattern of facts.A further problem with the preference heterogeneity story is that it cannot explain the positive relationship between the level of labor income and the propensity to start entrepreneurial ventures.  Table \ref{table:8389transitions} shows that entry into entrepreneurship is strongly correlated with the initial level of labor income.  This is also true for young consumers who have not accumulated much net worth (not shown).  Unless there is some compelling reason to assume that people who are more risk tolerant also earn higher labor income, the pure preference heterogeneity story cannot explain this correlation.  (In fact, one might suppose that {\it ceteris paribus}, people who are more risk averse would have higher labor income because the level and the log standard deviation of permanent labor income are negatively related (Carroll and Samwick~\cite{carroll&samwick:nature}).  In particular, people with higher levels of education have higher and less variable incomes, so people who are highly risk averse should choose to get more education, which would induce a negative, not a positive, correlation between the level of labor income and risk tolerance.A final problem with the preference heterogeneity story is that it provides no explanation for the failure of the elderly rich to spend down their assets.  Indeed, because risk tolerance is positively correlated with the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in models with time-separable preferences, we should actually expect the rich to be running down their wealth {\it faster} than the non-rich if the only differences between the rich and non-rich is in their degree of risk tolerance.Given that the preference heterogeneity story implicitly also requires some form of capital market imperfections in order to explain the data, it is interesting to examine whether capital market imperfections alone might work.The central requirement of any story based on capital market imperfections is that business ownership must yield higher-than-market rates of return.  We have done considerable research in the economic and business literatures to attempt to find a credible estimate of the rate of return on closely-held business ventures, but have found nothing usable for our purposes.  We intend in the next draft of the paper to examine this by checking whether wealth accumulation is greater on average over the 1983-89 panel for households who are business owners in 1983.Suppose for the moment that we accept on faith the proposition that closely-held business ventures earn higher rates of return (in exchange for higher risk) than is available on open capital markets, and that such ventures must be self-financed for moral hazard or adverse selection reasons.  By themselves, and in the absence of preference heterogeneity, these assumptions cannot explain the correlation between the level of initial labor income or initial wealth and the propensity to start businesses documented in table \ref{table:8389transitions}.  As anyone who has read the fine novel {\it A Confederacy of Dunces} knows, there are principal/agent and moral hazard problems even for a hot dog stand vendor, so the same logic that leads to the conclusion that other entrepreneurial ventures should yield a high rate of return should apply in this context as well.  Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave} address this problem by simply assuming that there is a minimum efficient scale for business enterprises which is large relative to the resources of the median household, but this approah is unsatisfactory because the richest households would have wealth vastly greater than the minimum efficient scale and therefore would have no need to tie up more than a trivial fraction of their total net worth in the business enterprise.  Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} deals with this problem by postulating a complicated `ladder' of business opportunities at rising minimum efficient scales.Even if we were to accept the story that there is a complicated ladder of minimum efficient scales of business operation {\it a la}Quadrini, the capital market imperfections story still has a big problem:  once again, it provides no explanation for the failure ofthe rich elderly to begin running down their wealth.  Again, ifwe accept the standard model's assumption that the only purpose ofsaving is to finance one's own future consumption, there is simplyno way to explain the failure of the elderly to eventually spend.An alternative explanation for the observation that entry rates into entrepreneurship are strongly related to {\it ex ante} wealth is the possibility that the rich are less risk averse than the rest of us.  Some evidence on this is presented in Table~\ref{table:riskaver}.  The table shows that occupants of the highest `permanent' income and net worth brackets are notably more likely to express a great willingness to accept above-average risk in exchange for above-average returns.  Even more dramatic is the difference between the proportion of the rich and of the rest who express themselves as `not willing to take any financial risks.'  Among the richest 1 percent by wealth, less than ten percent express such extreme risk aversion; among the bottom 80 percent, nearly half express this sentiment.The simplest interpretation of this table, of course, would be interms of the heterogeneous preferences story outlined above.  But,as we have already noted, that story has several problems of its own.Note, however, that the results in this table are precisely whatwould be expected if the `capitalist spirit' model is correct:because the rich have sufficient wealth that they plan to leave a large proportion as a bequest, their risk aversion is lower than that of others, just as indicated in this table.  We intend in the revised version of this test to use the 83-89panel data to attempt to provide some direct evidence on the direction of the causality between the level of wealth or income and risk preferences.  \section{Conclusions}[To be completed].\vfill\eject\bibliographystyle{Portable:latex:econometrica}\bibliography{Portable:latex:economics}\vfill\eject}{} % End ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowFirstStuff}}\ifthenelse{\boolean{Tables}}{\baselineskip 12pt\begin{table}\caption{Major Features of the Tax Code Relevant for the Rich}\label{table:laws}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:laws.eps}}\end{table}\clearpage\begin{table}\caption{Ownership Rates of Assets and Liabilities}\label{table:pctown}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:pctown.eps}}\end{table}\clearpage\begin{table}\caption{Composition of Net Worth}\label{table:compnw}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:compnw.eps}}\end{table}\clearpage\begin{table}\caption{Composition of Net Worth by Risk Category}\label{table:riskysafe}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:riskysafe.eps}}\end{table}\clearpage\begin{table}\caption{Degree of Diversification of Portfolio Structure}\label{table:diversification}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:diversification.eps}}\vspace{.15in}\noindent Note: A description of the asset classifications appears in the notes at the end of Table \ref{table:riskysafe}.\noindent Source: Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers and Surveys of Consumer Finances\end{table}\clearpage\begin{table}\caption{Risk Bearing By Age}\label{table:riskbyage}\vspace{.3in}\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:riskbyage.eps}}\vspace{.05in}\noindent Notes: The definition of risky financial assets corresponds to the sum of clearly risky and probably risky assets defined in Table \ref{table:riskysafe}.

The five categories are condensed from the categories laid out in Table~\ref{table:riskysafe}: Riskyis the sum of clearly and probably risky, Safe is the sum of clearly and probably safe, Business is the sum of equity in privately held businesses and the net value of investment real estate, and Miscellaneous absorbs all the other categorieswhich did not fit into the foregoing scheme (primarily consumerinstallment debt).  \ifthenelse{\boolean{Tables}}{\begin{figure}	\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:compareportfolios.eps}}	\medskip\medskip\medskip\medskip	\label{table:compareportfolios}\end{figure}}As noted above but seen more clearly here, the principal difference between the portfolio allocations of the rich and the rest comes in allocations between net worth held in businesses (42 percent for the rich, 18 percent for the rest) and that held in home equity (only 6 percent for the rich, almost 40 percent for the rest).  If we lump business assets with the `risky' category to form a `total risky assets' category, the contrast between the rich and the rest is stark.  For the rich, the `total risky' proportion of the portfolio is 72 percent; for the rest, that proportion is 43 percent.  Furthermore, these figures almost certainly represent an {\it underestimate} of the extra risk-bearing by the rich, because they ignore the fact that much of the `labor' income of the rich is directly tied to the success of their business enterprise.  These patterns are remarkably steady across decades and surveys, and this stability suggests suggests that it is not hopeless to search for general theoretical principles to explain them.\ifthenelse{\boolean{FlorenceVersion}}{Within the population of the rich, it is useful to compare those who are business owners to those who are not.  Under the assumption (henceforth maintained) that private business equity is riskier than any other form of asset, theory would suggest that if people do not differ in their intrinsic levels of risk aversion, among people with comparable levels of overall net worth the proportion of the remainder of their portfolio that is invested in risky assets would be lower.  This proposition receives little support: business owners hold 18 percent of their portfolios in safe and 24 percent in risky assets, for a ratio of 18/24 = .75.  For the rich as a whole, the ratio is 22/30 = .73.A natural hypothesis is that the business owners are more risk tolerant than non-business owners.  Since, as we noted above, most of the non-business owners who are rich have received inheritances, the natural hypothesis is that the inheritors are more risk-averse than the non-inheritors.  This can be checked by comparing the next four panels of the table.  Among business owners who received an inheritance, the proportion of safe to risky is 17/28 = 61 percent.  Among the non-inheritors, that ratio is only 11/24 = 46 percent.  Among the non-business owners, the contrast is even more dramatic: for the inheritors, the ratio of safe to risky is 39/47 = 83 percent, while for the non-inheritors that ratio is 24/53=47 percent.}\begin{table}[tbp]\center\begin{tabular}[c]{lccc}          & Spending  & Spending  \\   	      &  Usually   & Exceeded  \\   	      &  Exceeds   & Income    \\   	      &  Income    & this year \\ \hline          &  .05    & .23       \\ \end{tabular}	\caption{Saving By the Wealthy Elderly With and Without Children}	\protect\label{table:SavOfRichOld}\end{table}\subsubsection{How Did They Get So Rich?}Conceptually, there are two possible sources for the wealth that any household commands at any point in time: it is either the result of their own past saving accumulated at some rate of return, or the result of an inheritance, also accumulated at some rate of return since the time of receipt.  In practice it is very difficult to decompose wealth into these two components, because any such decomposition requires a complete model of how household consumption/saving decisions are made (because the amount of wealth `remaining' from an inheritance depends on the proportion of that inheritance that was spent in every period between its receipt and the present).Wealth to `permanent' income ratios at the top of the distribution are so extremely high that it is tempting to conclude that they must largely reflect inheritances - particularly for the younger households who seemingly have not had time to accumulate much wealth by saving it.  Table~\ref{table:howgotrich} shows the proportion of the richest households in each age group who reported ever having received an inheritance in the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs (unfortunately, the questions about inheritances on earlier SCFs were quite different and are more difficult to interpret, so they are not reported).  While it is true that the proportion of rich households who have received inheritances is more than twice the proportion for the rest of the population, in all three surveys substantially less than half of the richest households admitted to ever having received an inheritance.  This holds true even for young rich households.If they didn't inherit it, they must have made it themselves.  The next panel of the table suggests how: there is a dramatic contrast between the entrepreneurial activities of the rich and those of the general population.  Following Gentry and Hubbard, we define a household as a `business owner' if it reported at least \$5,000 of net equity (1992 dollars, consistent across surveys) in a business venture in which the household had an `active' management role.\footnote{This definition is different from the one employed in Table \ref{table:pctown}: in that table, the household was counted as owning business equity if it had any positive amount of business equity, whether the owner was passive or active.} Among the general population, only between 10 and 15 percent of households are business owners by this definition.  But among the richest households, the proportion who are business owners is between 65 and 80 percent in the younger age bracket and between 70 and 80 percent in the older bracket.The remainder of the table breaks down the population and the top one percent by the joint characteristics of business owner and inheritor.  The question of greatest interest is whether it is possible to get rich without either inheriting or starting a business.  Roughly speaking, the answer is no.  For the younger age group, only about 15 percent of the richest one percent had neither received an inheritance nor was actively engaged in running a privately held business (compared to around 75 percent of the general population who had done neither).  For the older age group, the proportion of rich non-owner non-inheritors averages less than ten percent.  Furthermore, these figures reflect only entrepreneurial activity at the time of the survey, so these figures likely represent an upper bound on the proportion who have gotten rich by means other than entrepreneurshipand inheritance.The foregoing discussion suggested that for those not lucky enough to inherit wealth, almost the only road to riches is to start a successful business.  The implicit story is essentially that in Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} and Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave}: entreprenuership earns considerably above-market returns (in exchange for high risk) because there are capital market imperfections (such as adverse selection or moral hazard) which mandate that entrepreneurial ventures must be financed in large part by the entrepreneur's personal wealth.  Call this the risk-and-return story.There is an alternative interpretation that is equally consistent with the data presented thus far: once people become rich (never mind how), they find the joys of entrepreneurship so enticing that they are willing to devote a large portion of their wealth to entrepreneurial ventures, even if those ventures do {\it not} earn higher-than-market returns; indeed, they could even earn below-market returns if the prospect of being one's own boss were sufficiently tantalizing to be worth a financial sacrifice.  Call this the business-as-luxury story.The two hypotheses can only be distinguished by examining the {\it dynamics} of entrepreneurship and wealth.  The risk-and-return story implies that much of the wealth of the rich was accumulated {\it after} they became entrepreneurs, and as a consequence of that entrepreneurship; the business-as-luxury story would imply that wealth causes (and perhaps Granger-causes) entrepreneurship rather than the other way around.Gentry and Hubbard provide considerable evidence for the risk-and-return story using data from the 1983-1989 panel component of the SCFs.  Given that there are two possibilities for entrepreneurship status in each of the two years, they divide their sample into four types of households: those that are entrepreneurs in both years (STAYIN); those that are entrepreneurs in 1983 but not 1989 (EXIT); those that are not entrepreneurs in 1983 but are in 1989 (ENTER); and those that are not entrepreneurs in either survey (STAYOUT).Gentry and Hubbard show the following:\begin{enumerate}\item The level of wealth and the wealth-to-income ratios of both the ENTER and the STAYIN groups increase much more than the level of wealthor the wealth-to-income ratio of the STAYOUT group\item The EXIT group experiences a substantial {\it decline} in net worth\item Controlling for demographic characteristics, the ranking of the groups by rate of accumulation is $\{$STAYIN,ENTER,STAYOUT,EXIT$\}$.\item The probability that 1983 nonentrepreneurs would become entrepreneurs by 1989 was much greater for those with high 1983 wealth.\end{enumerate}One unfortunate omission in the Gentry and Hubbard paper is any information on the proportion of households in each of these groups.  While the information they report rather compellingly shows that those who exit lose a lot of money, there is no information on the {\it proportion} of 1983 entrepreneurs who exited by 1989.Quadrini does present some useful statistics on exit rates.  He finds that the probability of exit is almost 50 percent in the first year of an entreprenurial venture (corresponding nicely with the anecdotal rule-of-thumb that half of all new businesses fail in their first year), but the exit rate declines to 30 percent in the second year and is only 13 percent for entrepreneurs whose business has survived for three years or more.\footnote{Quadrini also presents evidence similar to the Gentry/Hubbard evidence on the ranking of wealth and wealth/income transitions among the four classes of households with respect to entrepreneurial status.} Thus, it would appear that the risk of exit is quite large, and remains substantial even for relatively established entrepreneurs.Both papers present evidence that entry rates are substantially higher for households with higher initial net worth, and both implicitly or explicitly endorse the idea that this suggests that there is some minimum efficient scale of business operation that is large relative to the net worth or income of the typical household.  It is not entirely clear that this assumption is justified.  The capital required to operate a hot dog stand is not large even relative to the meager net worth of the median houseold.  As anyone who has read the fine novel {\it A Confederacy of Dunces} knows, there are principal/agent and moral hazard problems even for a hot dog stand vendor, so the same logic that leads to the conclusion that other entrepreneurial ventures should yield a high rate of return should apply in this context as well.An alternative explanation for the observation that entry rates into entrepreneurship are strongly related to {\it ex ante} wealth is the possibility that the rich are less risk averse than the rest of us.  Some evidence on this is presented in Table~\ref{table:riskaver}.The table shows that occupants of the highest `permanent' income and net worth brackets are notably more likely to express a great willingness to accept above-average risk in exchange for above-average returns.  Even more dramatic is the difference between the proportion of the rich and of the rest who express themselves as `not willing to take any financial risks.'  Among the richest 1 percent by wealth, less than ten percent express such extreme risk aversion; among the bottom 80 percent, nearly half express this sentiment.The table raises an obvious causality problem, however, especially with respect to the rankings by level of wealth - maybe most of the people in the top net worth brackets got there because they started out no richer than anybody else to begin with, but were less risk averse and therefore took high risks and reaped great rewards.  Distinguishing this possibility from the more straightforward interpretation (that higher wealth and income cause, rather than are caused by, low risk averison) will be a chief mission of the empricial work in the next version of this paper.Unfortunately, neither Gentry and Hubbard nor Quadrini present evidence on entry rates into entrepreneurship by initial level of income.  The question of whether high-income households are also more likely to become entrepreneurs will be addressed in the later version of this paper.\ifthenelse{\boolean{ModelsVersion}}{\vfill\clearpage\section{Four Models}\subsection{Description of the Models}\subsubsection{The Basic Stochastic Life Cycle Model with Portfolio Choice}Within the last decade, advances in computer speed and numerical methods have finally allowed economists to solve life cycle consumption/saving problems with serious uncertainty and realistic utility (see, in particular, Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes~\cite{hsz:importance}; Huggett~\cite{huggett:wealth}; Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih}; and the references therein).  I have argued elsewhere (Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih}) that the implications of these models fit the available evidence on the consumption/saving behavior of the typical household reasonably well, certainly much better than the old Certainty Equivalent (CEQ) models did.The standard procedure in all of these papers has been to assume that household savings earn a constant, riskfree rate of return $R$.  Recently, a wave of papers (Haliassos and Bertaut~\cite{haliassos&bertaut:fewholdstocks}, Fratantoni~\cite{fratantoni:equitypremium},Gakidis~\cite{gakidis:stocksforold}; Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout~\cite{cgm:lcportfolio}; and Hochgurtel~\cite{hochgurtel:bufferportfolio}) has examined the predictions of these kinds of models when consumers facing labor income risk are allowed to choose freely between investing in a low-return safe asset like the one considered in the earlier models and investing in risky assets parameterized to resemble the returns yielded by equity investments in the past.The following model is what I will characterize as the basic stochastic life cycle model with portfolio choice.  The consumer's goal is to solve the problem\begin{eqnarray*}	\max &  & \sum_{s=t}^{T} \beta^{s-t} \mathcal{D}_{t,s} u(C_{t})  \label{eq:maxutil} \\\end{eqnarray*}where $u(C)$ is a constant relative risk aversion utility function $u(C)=c^{1-\rho}/(1-\rho)$, $\beta$ is the (constant) geometric discount factor, and $\mathcal{D}_{t,s} = \prod_{h=t}^{s-1}(1-d_{h})$ is the probability that the consumer will not die between periods $t$ and $s$ ($\mathcal{D}_{t,t}$ is defined to be 1; $d_{t}$ is the probability of death between period $t$ and $t+1$).The maximization is of course subject to constraints.  In particular, if, following Deaton~\cite{deatonLiqConstrs}, we define $X_{t}$ as `cash-on-hand' at time $t$, the sum of wealth and current income, then the consumer faces a budget constraint of the form\begin{eqnarray*}	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1}\end{eqnarray*}where $S_{t} = X_{t}-C_{t}$ is the portion of last period's resources the consumer did not spend, $R_{t+1}$ is the gross rate of return earned by the consumer's entire portfolio between $t$ and $t+1$, and $Y_{t+1}$ is the noncapital income the consumer earns in period $t+1$.The portfolio-weighted return $R_{t+1}$ will depend on the proportion of the portfolio that is allocated to the safe and the risky assets, and on the rate of return on the risky asset between $t$ and $t+1$.  Call the proportion of the portfolio invested in the risky asset (`stocks') $w_{s,t}$ (where $w$ is mnemonic for the portfolio `weight'), and $(1-w_{s,t})$ is the portion invested in the safe asset.  If the return on stocks between $t$ and $t+1$ is $R_{s,t+1}$, the portfolio-weighted return on the consumer's savings will be $R(1-w_{s,t})+R_{s,t}w_{s,t}$.  Assume that the consumer's noncapital income in each period is given by their permanent income $P_{t}$ mutiplied by a mean-one transitory shock, $E_{t}[\epsilon_{t+1}] = 1$, and assume that permanent income grows at rate $G_{t}$ between periods, but is also buffeted by a mean-one shock, $P_{t+1} = G_{t+1}P_{t}\eta_{t+1}$ such that $E_{t} [\eta_{t+1}]=1$.Given these assumptions, the consumer's choices are influenced byonly two state variables at a given point in time: the level of the consumer's assets $X_{t}$ and the level of permanent income, $P_{t}$.As usual, the problem can be rewritten in recursive form with a valuefunction $V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t})$.  Written out fully in this form,the consumer's problem is\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta \mathcal{D}_{t,t+1} E_{t}\left[V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1}) \right] \nonumber\\ 	 & \mbox{such that} &   	\label{eq:bellmanstd}  \\	S_{t}   & = & X_{t}-C_{t} \nonumber \\	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1} \nonumber \\	Y_{t+1} & = & P_{t+1}\epsilon_{t+1} \nonumber \\	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \eta_{t+1} \nonumber \\	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}w_{s,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray}\subsubsection{Parameterization}The papers cited earlier that examine the predictions of such models universally find that with plausible assumptions about tastes (in particular, assuming a coefficient of relative risk aversion of less than 5), the models predict that consumers will want to invest a large fraction of their portfolios in stocks.  As several authors have noted, this is the microeconomic manifestation of the equity premium puzzle pointed out by Mehra and Prescott~\cite{mehraPrescottPuzzle}.In order to obtain at least a rough match between the data and the predictions of the baseline model, I will make several parameterization assumptions which will discourage consumers from holding a risky asset like stocks.  In the end, it will still be necessary to assume a high value for the coefficient of relative risk aversion, but not so high as would be necessary for more conventional parametric assumptions.\subsubsection{The Labor Income Process}Perhaps the most easily measured of the parameters of the model is$G_{t}$, the determininstic component of the pattern of earnings overthe life cycle.  Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih} presents age/earningsprofiles for consumers in various different occupations; I simply adopt the middle of the three stylized parameterizations that he argues fit different occupations reasonably well.  Details are in the appendix.A number of studies have examined the characteristics of household income processes and found that exclusive of periods when household income drops very sharply, the income process is reasonably well characterized by assuming that both the transitory and permanent shocks to income are serially uncorrelated and lognormally distributed.  Carroll~\cite{carroll:brookings} presented evidence that household incomes occasionally fall very dramatically, usually in periods when the household head is either unemployed for an extended period or is ill or disabled; I will follow that paper in assuming that the probability that household income is zero is given by $p_{\epsilon} = Pr(\epsilon = 0) = .005$.  If the realization of $\epsilon_{t}$ is nonzero then $\epsilon_{t}$ is distributed lognormally with a mean such that $E_{t} [\tilde{\epsilon}_{t+1}] = 1$.  This implies that $E_{t} [\tilde{\epsilon_{t}} | \epsilon_{t} > 0] = 1/(1-p_{\epsilon}).$ Using the fact that for a lognormally distributed variable $z$\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E[z] & = & E[\log z] + \frac{1}{2} \mbox{var}[\log z]  \end{eqnarray*}we have that\begin{eqnarray*}\log E[\epsilon | \epsilon>0] & = & E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] + \frac{1}{2}\mbox{var}_{t}[\log \epsilon | \epsilon > 0]\end{eqnarray*}Using the approximation that $\log[1/(1-p_{\epsilon})] \approx p_{\epsilon}$ if $p_{\epsilon}$ is small, this gives us that\begin{eqnarray*}p_{\epsilon} & \approx & E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] + \mbox{var}_{t}[\log \epsilon | \epsilon > 0] \\E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] & \approx & p_{\epsilon}-\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}/2 \end{eqnarray*}and thus our assumption is that \begin{equation}\log \epsilon_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(p_{\epsilon}-\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}/2,\sigma^{2}_{\epsilon})\end{equation}Similarly, but more simply, we assume that $\eta_{t+1}$ is lognormally distributed such that $E_{t}[\eta_{t+1}] = 1$ implying that the distribution for $\eta$ is $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{\eta}^{2}/2,\sigma_{\eta}^{2})$.  We use the parameter estimates obtained in Carroll~\cite{carroll:brookings} using data from the {\it Panel Study of Income Dynamics}: $\sigma_{\epsilon}=\sigma_{\eta}=.1$.\subsubsection{The Capital Income Process}The 3-month T-bill is the closest real-life proxy to a truly riskless asset, because inflation risk at high frequencies is small.  The average rate of return on the three-month T-bill in the postwar period has been about zero.  However, to match the model to data, we will have to make a decision about which assets in real life are ``risky'' and which are ``riskless.''  Because the real-life assets that we will identify with the model's `riskless' asset are at least slightly risky and consequently earn a higher rateof return than the t-bill, we somewhat arbitrarily fix the realrate of return on the `riskless' asset at 2 percent.One might suppose that the appropriate assumption about the distribution of shocks to stock returns was well pinned down by the available data.  However, Cochrane~\cite{cochrane:uncertainfacts} applies a variety of sophisticated tests to historical stock return data and concludes that a reasonable confidence interval for the average historical equity premium is between 3 percent and 13 percent.  Because some of the more plausible explanations of the equity premium puzzle assert that, whatever the {\it ex post} returns may have been, most people did not {\it ex ante} anticipate that stocks would perform as well as they have (and because assuming a small equity premium helps the model fit the data), my baseline parameterization will assume that the equity premium is only three percent.  The baseline assumption is that with probability $(1-p^{s})$ stock returns will be distributed lognormally with a mean $\overline{R}_{s} = E_{t} R^{s}_{t+1} = 1.05$ or 3 percent in excess of the return available on the safe asset and a standard deviation $\sigma^{s} = .2$ which is approximately equal to the annual standard deviation of returns on the S\&P 500 over the period 1925-1995 according to Gakidis~\cite{gakidis:stocksforold}.  With probability $p^{s}$ there is a stock market `crash' in which the gross return is $R^{s}_{t+1}= .1$.  This is meant to capture the experience of the Great Depression in the U.S., when the value of the S\&P 500 fell by about 90 percent from its 1929 peak to its 1933 trough, and more broadly to capture the empirical fact that stock returns are not quite lognormally distributed but instead exhibit `fat tails.'  In combination with the presence of a small chance of unemployment spells, this assumption is sufficient to prevent consumers from holding all of their assets in stocks, because of the small risk that labor income and the stock porfolio could both fall to nearly zero at the same time, driving the marginal utility of consumption to infinity.\subsubsection{Tastes}Taste parameters are difficult to measure and so the usual procedureis to make assumptions about the other parameters and then determinewhat structure of tastes is consistent with observed behavior.  Thisis the procedure that has led to the implausibly high estimates ofthe coefficient of relative risk aversion in the past.  I will followthis procedure in the sense that I will search for a value of the coefficient of relative risk aversion in my baseline model suchthat, given the other parameteric assumptions, most households wishto hold only a small proportion of their portfolio, or none at all,in stocks.  Even more difficult to measure than risk aversion is the pure rate of time preference.  The only credible estimate I know of comes from very recent work by Gourinchas and Parker~\cite{gourinchas&parker:lifecycle}, who   The usual assumption is that the annual rate of time preference is three or four percent; following Carroll~\cite{carroll:bslcpih}, I will assume a time preference rate of four percent.Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave}, Huggett~\cite{huggett:wealth}, Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship}, and others have argued that the `standard' version of the model which lacks the option of investing in stocks cannot reproduce the high saving rates observed at the top of the income spectrum.  I will therefore modify the modelto incorporate the modifications that these authors have suggestedmay be necessary to bring the predictions of the model intoaccord with the data.\subsection{The `Capitalist Spirit'}Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} has argued that in order to explain the saving behavior of the truly wealthy it is necessary to modify the standard model to provide a mechanism by which the ownership of wealth yields utility directly.  That paper proposes a model in which consumers decide between consumption and wealth:\begin{eqnarray} 	\max_{c_{t}} & ~~u(C_{T}) + B(s_{T}) \\ \nonumber  	           & \mbox{s.t.~} S_{T} = X_{T} - C_{T}.  \nonumber\end{eqnarray}where $u(c)$ is the standard CRRA utility function but $B(S)$ takesa modified Stone-Geary form, \begin{eqnarray*}B(S) &= &\frac{(S + \gamma)^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha}.\end{eqnarray*}Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} shows that if one assumes that $\alpha<\rho$ then wealth will be a `luxury good' in the sense that as lifetime resources rise, a larger proportion of those resources is devoted to $S_{T}$.  In the limit as $X_{T}$ approaches infinity, the proportion of resources devoted to $S_{T}$ approaches 1.  The other salient feature of the model is that if $\lambda > 0$ there will be a range of values of lifetime income for which the optimal choice is to consume all resources and set $S_{T}=0$.The simplest interpretation is that this is a model of bequests as luxury goods.  Interpreted in this way, it implies that people withlow levels of lifetime incomes leave no bequests because they alwaysfind the marginal utility of consumption to be higher than the marginalutility of even the first dollar of a bequest, but that above somethreshold level of lifetime income (permanent income) one devotes an increasingly large proportion of lifetime resources to bequests.Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} argues that the model can be interpreted more loosely as capturing a more direct effect of wealth on utility.  In this paper I will stick with the bequests interpretation, though it bears remembering that the implications for saving behavior are virtually the same whether one interprets the model as one of bequests or as a reduced-form for all of the satisfactions that may be conferred by the possession of wealth other than those yielded directly by consumption (power, status, grovelling by charitable organizations or relatives, etc.).In this paper the assumption is that one receives utility from the contemplation of the potential bequest in proportion to the probability that death (and the bequest) will occur.  Thus Bellman's equation is modified to:\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta (1-d_{t}) E_{t}\left[V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1}) \right] + d_{t} B(S_{t})\nonumber\\ \end{eqnarray}and the transition equations for the state variables are unchanged.Parameterization for this model is even more problematic than for the usual model.  The baseline assumption will simply be that $\alpha = \rho/2$, because that version of the model has some convenient analytical features.  The baseline assumption about $\lambda$ will be such that in the perfect-certainty case, the bequest motive would begin to manifest itself for consumers with a permanent income equal to twice the median level of permanent income.  These parametric assumptions are arbitrary, and it would be nice to have some compelling method for tying them down.  In principle, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ could be estimated using the methods pioneered by Gourinchas and Parker~\cite{gourinchas&parker:lifecycle}, although perhaps notuntil the Pentium 8 is introduced.\subsection{Quadrini/Gentry-Hubbard}Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} and Gentry and Hubbard~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave} propose a different explanation for the high saving rates of the wealthy: they argue that these high saving rates reflect the fact that entrepreneurs can earn higher rates of return than are available in the public capital markets.  These authors make plausible moral hazard and adverse selection arguments to explain why such capital market imperfections might exist, drawing upon the extensive literature from the last decade that has investigated the possibility that firms may face financing constraints.The models that Quadrini and Gentry and Hubbard propose are toocomplex to graft onto the already-complicated structure of thedynamic stochastic life cycle optimization problem considered above.  Fortunately, we can capture the essence of their modelswith a simpler structure.  The model of entrepreneurial investmentis as follows.Some consumers can invest a positive share of their portfolio $0 < w_{k,t} \leq 1$ in an entrepreneurial project.  In order to capture in the simplest possible way the higher return on self-financed projects emphasized by Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} and Hubbard and Gentry~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave}, the gross return on the entreprenurial project $R_{k,t}$ is scaled by a monotonically increasing function $\psi(w_{k,t})$ such that $\psi(1)=1$; that is, one can only reap the highest possible return on an entreprenurial project by investing one's entire net worth in that project.  The simplest choice of functional form for $\psi$ would be linear, but for technical reasons it is more convenient to assume that $\psi$ is quadratic (and concave).\footnote{Because $\psi'(w_{k,t})$ appears in the first order condition, assuming that $\psi$ is quadratic helps to guarantee that there will be a uniquely optimal portfolio share choice for $w_{k,t}$.}It is difficult to know how to parameterize the rate of return for the entrepreneurial project.  Because entrepreneurial investment is undoubtedly riskier than stock market investment, it is clear that we should assume some `entrepreneurial premium,' $E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]>E_{t}[R_{s,t+1}]$.  Our baseline assumption is that $\overline{R}_{k} = E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]=1.16$ or $0.10$ higher than the expected return on stocks, and that the stochastic distribution of rates of return around $\overline{R}_{k}$ mimics the distribution of the rate of return on stocks except that there is a much larger probability of entrepreneurial `failure' (in which $R_{k,t+1}=0$) than there is of a stock market crash (in which $R_{s,t+1}=.1$).  Specifically, our baseline assumption is that the probability of `bankruptcy' of the entreprenurial project is $p_{k}=.1$ annually.\footnote{Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} provides evidence that the rate of failure for entrepreneurs who have been self-employed for three years or longer is $.1$ annually.  The failure rate in the first two years of entrepreneurial activity is much greater, but the additional modelling complication and solution time required to capture this phenomenon did not seem worth the payoff of greater realism.}To complete the specification of our treatment of entrepreneurial investment, we assume that $\lim_{w_{k}\rightarrow 0} \psi(w_{k}) = R/ E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]$; that is, if the consumer were to invest an infinitesimal amount in the entrepreneurial project, the expected rate of return would be $R$, the riskfree return, but the project would still bear the large {\it ex ante} risks associated with entrepreneurial ventures.Not all households are allowed to pursue an entrepreneurial project in every period.  Any household that pursued an entrepreneurial project in period $t-1$ is eligible to continue that entrepreneurial activity.  But period $t-1$ nonentrepreneurs are permitted to invest in an entrepreneurial project in period $t$ only if they are lucky enough to obtain a new  `idea,' an event that occurs with probability $\overline{n}$ in each period.  (Formally, $\tilde{n} \sim u[0,1]$ and one obtains an idea if $\tilde{n} \leq \overline{n}$).  If a consumer who is currently engaged in an entrepreneurial activity decides to invest none of his portfolio in the project in this period, then that consumer cannot resume the project next period; he joins the pool of `nonentrepreneurs' and must await the next random draw of an entrepreneurial `idea.'  The variable $Q_{t} \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether the consumer is eligible to pursue an entrepreneurial idea.For technical reasons the best way to specify the portfolio allocation problem is to have consumers first decide how much of their total wealth to invest in the entrepreneurial project, and then decide how to allocate the remaining non-entrepreneurial wealth between the riskless asset and stocks.  Mathematically, $w_{k,t}$ of the entire portfolio is invested in the entrepreneurial project, leaving $(1-w_{k,t})$ to allocate between riskless and risky investment, with $w_{s,t}$ designating the portion of this remainder allocated to stocks.To summarize, the rate of return earned by a consumer who saves anypositive amount $S_{t}$ in period $t$ is given by $R_{t+1}$ where:\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t}-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t+1} 	\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray*}\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowTrueEqns}}{The actual solution method, however, assumes the problem is solved intwo stages: first, make a choice about the entrepreneurial share $w_{k,t}$,then decide the percentage of the nonentrepreneurial share to invest instocks.  In this case the equation for $R_{t+1}$ is:\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t})(1-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}(1-w_{k,t})w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t+1} 	\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray*}}Finally, we assume that running an entrepreneurial project consumes a minimum amount of time $\tau>0$ and thus reduces the amount of wage income the entrepreneur earns to $Y_{t+1}(1-\tau)$; our baseline assumption is $\tau=.1$.  This assumption is necessary to prevent consumers who have ever received an entrepreneurial idea from keeping the entreprenurial project `alive' by investing an infinitesimal amount in the project in every period.  Such a strategy would preserve the option value inherent in the entrepreneurial project at an arbitrarily small cost; requiring some minimum fixed commitment of time imposes a lower bound on the cost of keeping the entrepreneurial option alive.Bellman's equation for this problem is:\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t},w_{k,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta E_{t}\left[(1-d_{t}) 	V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) \right] \nonumber\\ 	 & \mbox{such that} &   	\label{eq:bellmanQGH}  \\	S_{t}   & = & X_{t}-C_{t} \nonumber \\	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1}(1-\tau(w_{k,t}>0)) \nonumber \\	Y_{t+1} & = & P_{t+1}\epsilon_{t+1} \nonumber \\	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \eta_{t+1} \nonumber \\	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t}-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t}\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray}and\begin{equation}Q_{t+1} = \begin{cases}   1 & \text{if $w_{k,t} > 0$ and $Q_{t} = 1$}\\ 1 & \text{if $w_{k,t} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} < \overline{n}$}\\ 0 & \text{if $w_{k,t} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} \geq \overline{n}$}.\end{cases} \nonumber \end{equation}\subsection{Everything At Once}The final model to be considered combines the Carroll~\cite{carroll:richsave} `Capitalist Spirit' utility function with the entrepreneurial investment structure in the previous section.  The specification of the problem is identical to that for the previous section (\ref{eq:bellmanQGH}) except for the addition of $d_{t} B(S_{t})$ to the right hand side of the Bellman equation.\section{Comparing the Models to the Stylized Facts}The culmination of the paper is of course a comparison of thesimulation results from the models to the stylized facts developedin the first section.  In particular, we examine the performanceof the four models with respect to their conformity (or lack thereof)with the three principal stylized facts from the first section.}{}\begin{table}    \caption{Business Ownership Status and Inheritance Status}\vspace{.3in}	\centerline{\BoxedEPSF{:Tables:howgotrich.eps}}	\medskip\medskip\medskip\medskip	\label{table:howgotrich}\end{table}\clearpage
