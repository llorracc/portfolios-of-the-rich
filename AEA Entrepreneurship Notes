I've kind of arrived at this topic by accidentMain research interest has been in saving/consumption behavior, from macro perspective (esp. where does K come from)Concluded that can't understand that unless you understand behavior of 'the rich' whom I will define as those with NW in top 1 %; depending on the measure, 'the rich' own half or more of K; as we will see, can't understandbehavior of rich without understanding entrepreneurial activityStandard model: There's no such thing as 'the rich' 		homothetic utility implies everything scales up		LC models with homothetic utility, no bequest motive, and only ordinary 	rates of return don't work, even when there is PS. (I'm a big believer 	in the importance of PS for behavior of typical HH, but a plausible 	precautionary motive doesn't generate enough S).	[Fig 1 comparing top 1 pct from SCF and sims]			Actual wealth is several times larger than what comes out of sims,		even if you assume in the sims that people are perfectly patient		[Fig 2 showing that rich childless elderly do not dissave]	Second problem:	Portfolios of the rich contain *much* higher proportion of risky assets			Incidentally, this holds for every country for which we have HH 		level portfolio data				[Table 4- Broad risky assets comparison]	Third problem:	Much of the risky stuff is undiversified entrepreneurial wealth	From Table 4:  IRE+PBE for rich vs non-rich		From Table 10: largest business is 82 percent of all business wealth;					business-derived income is 44 percent of all income										hugely risky					How to make sense of this?	'Why do the Rich Save So Much?'	Add a bequest motive in which bequests are a 'luxury good'			u(c) + u(w)				[CRRA forms] - point about u'(w) declining slower	Important insight:			Restriction on parameter values generating bequests as luxury		ALSO generates lower risk aversion wrt bequest gambles				=> this model also explains fact 2, as an unanticipated bonus!			However, can't explain fact 3 (nondiversification of entrepreneurial wealth)		Gentry and Hubbard/Quadrini: 'Imperfect capital markets'			Specifically, moral hazard/adverse selection/principal agent 		problems mean that entrepreneurial ventures must have large element 		of self-financing				Requirement for self-financing means risk can't be diversified				Higher risk means equilibrium in market will only occur if higher return		is available				Higher return => saving is higher (under std assumptions)			Have they explained everything?  Just add cap mkt imperfections to std model?			No:			- Higher returns can generate higher saving by young, but if model			is right then eventually must dissave; data suggests there's not			nearly enough dissaving by rich elderly						- with standard CRRA u(c) model, nonentrepreneurial assets of 				entrepreneurs should be SUPER-safe; not true (Table 11)								direct evidence on risk tolerance:									1) rich express much more risk tolerance										2) exogenous, unanticipated increases in w produce 					large declines in risk tolerance							- can't (by itself) explain ev showing (w,y) -> entry into 			entreprenurship				u(w) as a luxury good can explain all three of theseConclusion:	Ev on entrepreneurship very important in understanding agg and HH saving 	behavior			- Entreprenurial activity can generate much higher returns but entails		a lot of risk				- Cap mkt imperfs are not sufficient; also need modification of 		prefs to explain overall pattern of facts									Basic problem is that if only goal in life is own consumption, the rich save far too muchSecond problem: portfolio behavior is nonhomothetic[Table showing NVPB+IRE = 55 pct of NW for top 1 pct, only 27% for 0-99][Table showing risky assets as 80 pct of top 1 pct, 41.2 pct for 0-99]In particular, doesn't look like rich elderly are dissaving; indeed,most of them seem to be spending less than their incomeHow about a dynastic bequest motive?  Parents get utility from kids' consumption, etc.?	Problem: 			Even *childless* rich elderly seem to spend less than Y	At the end of the day, I think people *like* being rich			Stories:	U(W) is a 'luxury good': those with low lifetime incomes can't afford 	to care about their wealth - they are too busy worrying about enough 	consumption	Proposed a simple formulation of this kind:	Lifetime Utility = () 		u'(w) declines more slowly than u'(c) => as lifetime income rises, 	more and more is 'spent' on accumulation	Interesting implication:	Risk aversion is much smaller for gambles with bequest wealth than	for gambles over own consumption	Portfolios of the rich:	[Table from 5 countries showing that in every case portfolios of rich have	much higher proportion of risky assets]		Alternative explanations for portfolio finding:			Initial heterogeneity in risk aversion, lucky risk-lovers get rich				Imperfect capital markets 					=> supranormal returns for entrepreneurs in exchange for 			nondiversificationConclusion:	Explaining both portfolio and saving patterns requires both 	ICM's and luxury-bequests		Luxury bequest motive alone can't explain nondiversification of risky 	assets		ICMs can't explain failure of rich to *eventually* dissave
