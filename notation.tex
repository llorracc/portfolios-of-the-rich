For a risky asset that is supposed to reflect the characteristics of equity markets, use the mnemonic `e'; that is, the return on equities between period $t$ and $t+1$ would be designated $R_{e,t+1}$.\item If you are working with more than three assets, use the variable $i$ as a subscript to indicate asset $i$ out of a list of up to $N$ assets.  Thus $R_{i,t}$ indicates the return on asset $i$ held from the end of period $t-1$ into period $t$.  \item $w_{i,t}$ indicates the portfolio weight given to asset $i$ for the holding period from the end of period $t$ into period $t+1$.\item Use boldface for vectors and matrices, and regular face for scalars.  Thus $w_{i,t}$ is a scalar and $\mathbf{w}_{t}$ is the vector ofthe values $w_{i,t}$ for all $i$.\item $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^{2})$ denotes the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.\item The mean expectation of a variable is designated by a bar over the variable.  Thus the statement that $r_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(\overline{r}_{i},\sigma^{2}_{r_{i}})$ indicates that $r_{i}$ is distributed normally with mean value $\overline{r}$.\item Pr(.) denotes the probability of an event\item $E_{t}[X_{s}]$ is the expectation given all information known as of time $t$ of the value of variable $X$ as of time $s$.  The unconditional expectation of a variable whose value varies with time is given by $E [X_{t}]$.\item A $\sim$ over a variable in an expectations formula indicates that the variable's value is stochastic viewed from the perspective of the period with respect to which the expectation is being taken.  Thus if $r_{i}$ is distributed lognormally as specified above, we can write $E_{t}[ \tilde{r}_{i,t+1}] = \overline{r}_{i}$.\end{itemize}\section{Parameter Definitions}\begin{eqnarray*}	\beta & - & \mbox{Time discount factor between periods}  \\	\rho & - & \mbox{Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion}  \\	X_{t} & - & \mbox{Gross resources (`cash-on-hand') available for spending in period $t$}  \\	S_{t} & - & \mbox{`Savings' left over at the end of period $t$ after consumption}  \\	C_{t} & - & \mbox{Consumption in period $t$}  \\	V_{t} & - & \mbox{Value function}  \\	u_{t} & - & \mbox{Utility function}  \\	B_{t} & - & \mbox{Utility from wealth/bequest function}  \\	W_{t} & - & \mbox{Proportion of portfolio in risky assets}  \\	R_{t} & - & \mbox{Total portfolio-weighted return between $t-1$ and $t$}  \\	Y_{t} & - & \mbox{Noncapital income in period $t$}  \\	P_{t} & - & \mbox{Permanent income in period $t$}  \\	\epsilon_{t} & - & \mbox{Transitory shock to noncapital income in period $t$}  \\	\eta_{t} & - & \mbox{Shock to permanent income in period $t$}  \\	d_{t} & - & \mbox{Probability of dying at the end of period $t$}  \\	p_{z} & - & \mbox{Probability that the variable $z$ is equal to zero}  \\\end{eqnarray*}\section{A Specific Problem} Using these conventions and a few others I will solve the notation problem recursively from the last period of life.Consider the optimization problem in the last period of life.  The consumer obtains utility $u(C_{T})$ from consumption and $B(S_{T})$ from any wealth $S_{T}$ that is unconsumed and thus is left behind as a bequest.  The value function gives the utility obtained from choosing last-period consumption $C_{T}$ optimally:\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{T}(X_{T}) & = & \max_{\{C_{T}\}} u(C_{T}) + B(S_{T})  \\	 & \mbox{such that} &   \\	S_{T} & = & X_{T}-C_{T} \\	S_{T} & \geq & 0 \end{eqnarray*}In the second-to-last period of life, the consumer must choose not only the level of consumption but also how to allocate any savings $S_{T-1}$ not consumed between the riskless asset and $N$ different potential risky asset categories.  Designate the proportion (or weight) of $S_{T-1}$ put into each of these possible assets $w_{i,T-1}$, and define $W_{T-1}=(1-\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i,T-1})$ as the total portfolio share in all risky assets implying that the portfolio share in the riskless asset will be (1-$W_{T-1}$).  Define the gross return on asset category $i$ between period $T-1$ and period $T$ as $R_{i,T}$ as per the guidelines, and define the portfolio-weighted average rate of return on savings between periods $T-1$ and $T$ as\begin{equation}R_{T} = R(1-W) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i,T-1} R_{i,T}.\end{equation}Designating the total noncapital income that the household receivesin the last period of life $Y_{T},$ total cash-on-hand in period $T$will be given by\begin{equation}X_{T} = R_{T} S_{T-1} + Y_{T}.\end{equation}In addition, assume that there is some probability $d_{T}$ that the consumer will die after performing this period's consumption but before beginning next period.  Finally, assume that the consumer is not allowed to die in debt and therefore cannot borrow.  The consumer's problem under these circumstances is \begin{eqnarray*}	V_{T-1}(X_{T-1}) & = & \max_{\{C_{T-1},\mathbf{w}_{T-1}\}} u(C_{T-1}) + (1-d_{T-1}) \beta E_{T-1} V_{T}(X_{T}) + d_{T-1} B(S_{T-1})  \\	 & \mbox{such that} &   \\	X_{T} & = & R_{T} S_{T-1} + Y_{T} \\	S_{T-1}& = & X_{T-1}-C_{T-1} \\	S_{T-1}& \geq & 0 \end{eqnarray*}or, substituting the constraints into the problem, we have:\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{T-1}(X_{T-1}) = &  &   \\	  \max_{\{C_{T-1},\mathbf{w}_{T-1}\}} & & u(C_{T-1}) + (1-d_{T-1}) \beta E_{T-1} \left[V_{T}(\tilde{R}_{T}[X_{T-1}-C_{T-1}]+\tilde{Y}_{T}) \right]+ d_{T-1} B(X_{T-1}-C_{T-1})  \\	 \mbox{such that} &  & C_{T-1} \leq X_{T-1}\end{eqnarray*}An analogous equation will hold for all earlier periods of life, so thatwe can state the general maximization problem as\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{t}(X_{t}) = &  &   \\	  \max_{\{C_{t},\mathbf{w}_{t}\}} & & u(C_{t}) + (1-d_{t}) \beta E_{t} \left[V_{t+1}(\tilde{R}_{t+1}[X_{t}-C_{t}]+\tilde{Y}_{t+1})\right] + d_{t} B(X_{t}-C_{t})  \\	 \mbox{such that} &  & C_{t} \leq X_{t}\end{eqnarray*}In the process of solving maximization problems numerically, itis often useful to define a function which yields the expectedvalue associated with pursuing every possible choice for thecontrol variables.  For this problem, the only way in which $C_{t}$ and $X_{t}$ affect $V_{t+1}$ is through their effects on $S_{t}$.  We can now define a function \begin{eqnarray*}	\Omega_{t}(S_{t},w_{1,t},\ldots,w_{N,t}) & = & (1-d_{t}) \beta E_{t}\left[ V_{t+1}(\tilde{R}_{t+1}S_{t}+\tilde{Y}_{t+1})\right] + d_{t} B(S_{t})  \\\end{eqnarray*}which returns the expected value from pursuing any possible choice of $S_{t}$ and portfolio share configuration, and the maximization problem can be rewritten somewhat more simply as:\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{t}(X_{t})  & = &  \max_{\{C_{t},\mathbf{w}_{t}\}} u(C_{t}) + \beta \Omega_{t}(S_{t},\mathbf{w}_{t})  \\  	 & \mbox{such that} & \\  	 S_{t} & = &    X_{t}-C_{t} \\  	 S_{t} & \geq & 0.\end{eqnarray*}Written in this way, the problem is formidably difficult to solve because it involves simultaneous nonlinear maximization with respect to $N+1$ choice variables ($C_{t}$ and $N$ portfolio shares).  One way of solving problems of this kind numerically is to define a series of functions\begin{eqnarray*}	\Omega_{N,t}(S_{t},w_{2,t},\ldots,w_{N-1,t}) & = & \max_{\{w_{N,t}\}} \Omega_{t}(S_{t},w_{2,t},\ldots,w_{N,t}) \\	\Omega_{N-1,t}(S_{t},w_{2,t},\ldots,w_{N-2,t}) & = & \max_{\{w_{N-1,t}\}} \Omega_{N,t}(S_{t},w_{2,t},\ldots,w_{N-1,t})\end{eqnarray*}which, given a fixed choice for $S_{t}$ and all of the portfolio shares up to a given share, finds the optimal value for that portfolio share given optimal choice of the remainder of portfolio shares.  The logic of this process is exactly equivalent to the logic behind the traditional recursive solution to dynamic optimization problems, and the process leads eventually to a function which yields the optimal value of any value of savings $S_{t}$ given optimal choice of portfolio shares, $\Omega_{*,t}(S_{t})$ where the * is used to indicate that optimal choice of portfolio shares is happening in the background.  The problem now can be written\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{t}(X_{t})  & = &  \max_{\{C_{t}\}} u(C_{t}) + \Omega_{*,t}(X_{t}-C_{t})  \\  	 & \mbox{such that} & \\  	 C_{t} & \leq & X_{t}\end{eqnarray*}Problems of this kind are usually solved using the first order conditions.  Define the derivative of a function $f(x,y,\ldots)$ with respect to its arguments as $f^{x}, f^{y}, \ldots$.  There will be one first order condition with respect to the portfolio share of each possible investment, possibly along with short sales constraints that require $0 \leq w_{i,t} \leq 1$ for all $i$.  Then there will be $N$ first order conditions with respect to the portfolio shares, one for each of the series of equations listed above, and each of these will take the form:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & \beta E_{t} \left[(\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}-R)S_{t}(1-d_{t})V_{t+1}^{X}(\tilde{X}_{t+1}) \right]. \end{eqnarray*}The first order condition for this problem with respect to consumption can be written:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & u^{c}(C_{t+1})+(1-d_{t})\beta E_{t} \left[\tilde{R}_{t+1} V_{t+1}^{X}(\tilde{X}_{T+1})\right] + d_{t}B^{S}_{t}(X_{t}-C_{t}). \end{eqnarray*}This equation will define the optimal level of consumption for any given choice of portfolio shares $\mathbf{w}_{t}$, unless the $C_{t}$ which satisfies this equation is greater than $X_{t}$, in which case the no-dying-in-debt constraint will bind and the consumer will spend $C_{t}=X_{t}$.A prototypical specification for the income process is as follows.  Realizedincome in period $t$ is given by permanent income in period $t$ times a multiplicative shock $\epsilon_{t}$:\begin{equation}Y_{t} = P_{t} \epsilon_{t}\end{equation}Often we assume that there is some positive probability that $\epsilon_{t} = 0$; write this probability as $p_{\epsilon} = $Pr($\epsilon_{t}=0$).  Often we assume that if the realization of $\epsilon_{t}$ is nonzero then $\epsilon_{t}$ is distributed lognormally with a mean such that $E_{t-1} [\tilde{\epsilon}_{t}] = 1$.  This implies that $E_{t-1} [\tilde{\epsilon_{t}} | \epsilon_{t} > 0] = 1/(1-p_{\epsilon}).$ Using the fact that for a lognormally distributed variable $z$\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E[z] & = & E[\log z] + \frac{1}{2} \mbox{var}[\log z]  \end{eqnarray*}we have that\begin{eqnarray*}\log E[\epsilon | \epsilon>0] & = & E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] + \mbox{var}_{t}[\log \epsilon | \epsilon > 0]\end{eqnarray*}Using the approximation that $\log[1/(1-p_{\epsilon})] \approx p_{\epsilon}$ if $p_{\epsilon}$ is small, this gives us that\begin{eqnarray*}p_{\epsilon} & \approx & E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] + \mbox{var}_{t}[\log \epsilon | \epsilon > 0] \\E[\log \epsilon | \epsilon>0] & \approx & p_{\epsilon}-\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}/2 \\\end{eqnarray*}and thus our assumption is that \begin{equation}\log \epsilon_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(p_{\epsilon}-\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}/2,\sigma^{2}_{\epsilon})\end{equation}Similarly, but more simply, we often assume that permanent income is growing at some rate $G_{t}$ from period to period but is hit by a multiplicative shock $\eta_{t}$:\begin{eqnarray*}	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t+1}P_{t}\eta_{t+1}  \\\end{eqnarray*}where usually the assumption is that $\eta_{t}$ is lognormally distributed such that $E_{t-1}[\eta_{t}] = 1$ implying that the distribution for $\eta$ is $\eta \sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma_{\eta}^{2}/2,\sigma_{\eta}^{2})$.\end{document}\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowFirstStuff}}{\subsubsection{Labor Income}Each household is characterized by a level of permanent income $P$ that evolves over time according to the process\begin{math}	P_{t} = \eta_{t}P_{t-1}\end{math}where $\log \eta_{t} \sim N(-\sigma_{\eta}^{2}/2,\sigma_{\eta}^{2})$ which implies that $E_{t-1} \eta_{t} = 1$ and following Carroll~\cite{carroll:brookings} we assume $\sigma_{\eta} = .1$.Realized noncapital income $Y_{t}$ is given by permanent income multiplied by a transitory shock $\zeta_{t}$,\begin{eqnarray*}	Y_{t} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \zeta_{t}\end{eqnarray*}where $G_{t}$ captures the age profile of earnings, $\zeta_{t}$ is equal to zero (representing a spell of unemployment) with probability $p^{y}=.01$ and otherwise is lognormally distributed with standard deviation $\sigma_{\zeta}=.1$ and with a mean such that $E_{t-1} \zeta_{t} = 1$.\subsubsection{Capital Income and Entrepreneurial Income}Some consumers can invest a positive share of their portfolio $0 < \omega_{t}^{k} \leq 1$ in an entrepreneurial project.  In order to capture in the simplest possible way the higher return on self-financed projects emphasized by Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} and Hubbard and Gentry~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave}, the gross return on the entreprenurial project $R_{t}^{k}$ is scaled by a monotonically increasing function $\Omega(\omega_{t}^{k})$ such that $\Omega(1)=1$; that is, one can only reap the highest possible return on an entreprenurial project by investing one's entire net worth in that project.  The simplest choice of functional form for $\Omega$ would be linear, but for technical reasons it is more convenient to assume that $\Omega$ is quadratic.\footnote{Because $\Omega'(\omega_{t}^{k})$ appears in the first order condition, assuming that $\Omega$ is quadratic helps to guarantee that there will be a uniquely optimal portfolio share choice for $\omega_{t}^{k}$.}It is difficult to know how to parameterize the rate of return for the entrepreneurial project.  Because entrepreneurial investment is undoubtedly riskier than stock market investment, it is clear that we should assume some `entrepreneurial premium,' $E_{t}R^{k}_{t+1}>E_{t}R^{s}_{t+1}$.  Our baseline assumption is that $\overline{R}^{k} = E_{t}R_{t+1}^{k}=1.16$ or $0.10$ higher than the expected return on stocks, and that the stochastic distribution of rates of return around $\overline{R}^{k}$ mimics the distribution of the rate of return on stocks except that there is a much larger probability of entrepreneurial `failure' (in which $R^{k}_{t+1}=0$) than there is of a stock market crash (in which $R^{s}_{t+1}=.1$).  Specifically, our baseline assumption is that the probability of `bankruptcy' of the entreprenurial project is $p^{k}=.1$ annually.\footnote{Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} provides evidence that the rate of failure for entrepreneurs who have been self-employed for three years or longer is $.1$ annually.  The failure rate in the first two years of entrepreneurial activity is much greater, but the additional modelling complication and solution time required to capture this phenomenon did not seem worth the payoff of greater realism.}To complete the specification of our treatment of entrepreneurial investment, we assume that $\lim_{\omega^{k}\rightarrow 0} \Omega(\omega^{k}) = R/ E_{t}R_{t+1}^{k}$; that is, if the consumer were to invest an infinitesimal amount $\epsilon$ in the entrepreneurial project, the expected rate of return would be $R$, the riskfree return, but the project would still bear the large {\it ex ante} risks associated with entrepreneurial ventures.Not all households are allowed to pursue an entrepreneurial project in every period.  Any household that pursued an entrepreneurial project in period $t-1$ is eligible to continue that entrepreneurial activity.  But period $t-1$ nonentrepreneurs are permitted to invest in an entrepreneurial project in period $t$ only if they are lucky enough to obtain a new  `idea,' an event that occurs with probability $\overline{n}$ in each period.  (Formally, $\tilde{n} \sim u[0,1]$ and one obtains an idea if $\tilde{n} \leq \overline{n}$).  If a consumer who is currently engaged in an entrepreneurial activity decides not to invest in the project in this period, then that consumer cannot resume the project next period; he joins the pool of `nonentrepreneurs' and must await the next random draw of an entrepreneurial `idea.'  The variable $Q_{t} \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether the consumer is eligible to pursue an entrepreneurial idea.For technical reasons the best way to specify the portfolio allocation problem is to have consumers first decide how much of their total wealth to invest in the entrepreneurial project, and then decide how to allocate the remaining non-entrepreneurial wealth between the riskless asset and stocks.  Mathematically, $\omega_{t}^{k}$ of the entire portfolio is invested in the entrepreneurial project, leaving $(1-\omega_{t}^{k})$ to allocate between riskless and risky investment, with $\omega_{t}^{s}$ designating the portion of this remainder allocated to stocks.To summarize, the rate of return earned by a consumer who saves $W_{t}$ in period $t$ is given by $\hat{R}_{t+1}W_{t}$ where:\begin{eqnarray*}	\hat{R}_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-\omega^{k}_{t})(1-\omega^{s}_{t}) + 	R_{t+1}^{s}\omega_{t}^{s}(1-\omega_{t}^{k}) + R_{t+1}^{k}Q_{t+1} 	\Omega(\omega_{t}^{k})\omega_{t}^{k} \nonumber \end{eqnarray*}Finally, we assume that running an entrepreneurial project consumes a minimum amount of time $\tau>0$ and thus reduces the amount of wage income the entrepreneur earns to $Y_{t+1}(1-\tau)$; our baseline assumption is $\tau=.1$.  This assumption is necessary to prevent consumers who have ever received an entrepreneurial idea from keeping the entreprenurial project `alive' by investing an infinitesimal amount $\epsilon$ in the project in every period.  Such a strategy would preserve the option value inherent in the entrepreneurial project at an arbitrarily small cost; requiring some minimum fixed commitment of time imposes a lower bound on the cost of keeping the entrepreneurial option alive.\subsubsection{Utility}The consumer derives utility from two sources: the ongoing utility from consumption obtained from the CRRA utility function $u(c) = c^{1-\rho}/(1-\rho)$, and the utility derived from the contemplation of the future bequest to be left.  The bequest utility function is of the form\begin{eqnarray*}	B(W) & = & \frac{(W+\lambda)^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} \\\end{eqnarray*}where the parameter restriction $\alpha<\rho$ is imposed because it implies that bequests are a luxury good, and $\lambda>0$ is imposed because it implies that there will be some level of permanent income below which the bequest motive will be inoperative (the desired bequest would be negative, which is ruled out).\subsubsection{Bellman's Equation}Bellman's equation for this problem is:\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},\omega_{t}^{s},\omega_{t}^{k}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta E_{t }\left[(1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})+ d_{t+1}B(W_{t}) \right] \nonumber\\ 	 & \mbox{such that} &   	\label{eq:bellmanraw}  \\	W_{t}   & = & X_{t}-C_{t} \nonumber \\	X_{t+1} & = & \hat{R}_{t+1}W_{t} + Y_{t+1}(1-\tau Q_{t}) \nonumber \\	Y_{t+1} & = & P_{t+1}\zeta_{t+1} \nonumber \\	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \eta_{t+1} \nonumber \\	\hat{R}_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-\omega^{k}_{t})(1-\omega^{s}_{t}) + 	R_{t+1}^{s}\omega_{t}^{s}(1-\omega_{t}^{k}) + R_{t+1}^{k}Q_{t+1} 	\Omega(\omega_{t}^{k})\omega_{t}^{k} \nonumber \end{eqnarray}and\begin{equation}Q_{t+1} = \begin{cases}1 & \mbox{if $\omega_{t}^{k} > 0$ and $Q_{t} = 1$} \\1 & \mbox{if $\omega_{t}^{k} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} < \overline{n}$}0 & \mbox{if $\omega_{t}^{k} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} \geq \overline{n}$}, \\\end{cases} \nonumber \end{equation}\section{Solution Procedure}Define the function\begin{equation*}\Omega_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k},\omega_{t}^{s}) = E_{t }\left[(1-d_{t+1}) V_{t+1}(\hat{R}_{t+1} W_{t}+Y_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})+ d_{t+1}B(W_{t})\right]\end{equation*}Now define the value function associated with the optimal stock investment share, given the share chosen for the entrepreneurial project:\begin{equation}{\overline{\Omega}_{t}}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k}) = \max_{\{\omega^{s}_{t}\}} \Omega_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k},\omega_{t}^{s}) \label{eq:FOCwrtomegak}\end{equation}Assuming there is an optimum for $\omega_{t}^{s}$ in the range $0 < \omega_{t}^{s} < 1$, and denoting the derivative of $\Omega_{t}$ with respect to $\omega_{t}^{s}$ as $\Omega_{t}^{s}$, that optimum will be characterized by the FOC:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & \overline{\Omega}_{t}^{s}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k})  \\	0 & = & \beta E_{t}\left[ \frac{\partial X_{t+1}}{\partial 	\omega^{s}_{t}} \left( (1-d_{t+1})	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right) \right]\\	0 & = & \beta E_{t} \left[(R^{s}_{t+1} - R)(1-\omega_{t}^{k})(W_{t}) \left((1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right)\right]\end{eqnarray*}Call the value of $\omega_{t}^{s}$ which satisfies the FOC $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{s}$. Then define \begin{equation}\check{\omega}_{t}^{s} = \begin{cases}1 & \mbox{if $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{s} > 1$,} \\0 & \mbox{if $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{s} < 0$,} \\\hat{\omega}_{t}^{s} & \mbox{if $0 < \hat{\omega}_{t}^{s} < 1$} \end{cases}\end{equation}Finally, the optimal stock investment value function $\overline{\Omega}_{t}$ is defined as:\begin{eqnarray*}	\overline{\Omega}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k}) & = & \max 	[\Omega_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k},\check{\omega}_{t}^{s}),	\Omega_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k},0),	\Omega_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k},1)]\end{eqnarray*}Similarly, define the value associated with the optimal entrepreneurial share as\begin{eqnarray*}	\overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & = & \max_{\{\omega_{t}^{k}\}} 	\overline{\Omega}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k})\end{eqnarray*}Assuming there is an optimum for $\omega_{t}^{k}$ in the range $0 < \omega_{t}^{k} < 1$, and denoting the derivative of $\overline{\Omega}_{t}$ with respect to $\omega_{t}^{k}$ as $\overline{\Omega}_{t}^{k}$, that optimum will be characterized by the FOC:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & \overline{\Omega}_{t}^{k}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\omega_{t}^{k})  \\      & = & \beta E_{t} \left[	R^{k}_{t+1}Q_{t+1}[ 	\Omega(\omega_{t}^{k})+\Omega^{'}(\omega^{k}_{t})\omega_{t}^{k}]	-(R(1-\omega_{t}^{s}) +       R_{t+1}^{s}\omega_{t}^{s}))W_{t} \left((1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right)\right] \\\end{eqnarray*}where implicitly we are assuming that the optimal stock share of nonentreprenurial wealth $\omega_{t}^{s}$ is being chosen optimally in the background.Call the value of $\omega_{t}^{k}$ which satisfies the FOC $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{k}$.  Then define \begin{equation}\check{\omega}_{t}^{k} = \begin{cases}1 & \mbox{if $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{k} > 1$,} \\0 & \mbox{if $\hat{\omega}_{t}^{k} < 0$,} \\\hat{\omega}_{t}^{k} & \mbox{if $0 < \hat{\omega}_{t}^{k} < 1$} \end{cases}\end{equation}Then the expected value function given optimal portfolio choices $\overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}$ is defined as:\begin{eqnarray*}	\overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & = & \max 	[\overline{\Omega}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},\check{\omega}_{t}^{k}),	\overline{\Omega}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},0),	\overline{\Omega}_{t}(W_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},1)]\end{eqnarray*}And we can rewrite the Bellman equation (\ref{eq:bellmanraw}) as \begin{eqnarray*}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta \overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}(X_{t}-C_{t},P_{t},Q_{t})\end{eqnarray*}for which the FOC is:\begin{eqnarray*}    0 & = & u'(C_{t}) + \beta     \overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}^{W}(X_{t}-C_{t},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) \\	0 & = & u'(C_{t}) + \beta E_{t}\left[ \frac{\partial X_{t+1}}{\partial 	C_{t}} \left( (1-d_{t+1})	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}B'(W_{t}) \right) \right]\\	u'(C_{t}) & = & \beta E_{t} \left[\hat{R}_{t+1} \left((1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}B'(W_{t})\right)\right] \\	C_{t}^{-\rho} & = & \beta E_{t} \left[\hat{R}_{t+1} \left((1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}(W_{t}+\lambda)^{-\alpha}\right)\right] \\	C_{t} & = & \left(\beta E_{t} \left[\hat{R}_{t+1} \left((1-d_{t+1}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1}) + d_{t+1}	(W_{t}+\lambda)^{-\alpha}\right)\right]\right)^{1/-\rho} \\\end{eqnarray*}where again the optimal shares are assumed to be chosen for each value of $C_{t}$ considered.Note that, using the Envelope theorem, we have that, if none of the implicit constraints are binding, the derivative of the Bellman equation with respect to $X_{t}$ is:\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{t}^{x} & = & \beta E_{t}\overline{\overline{\Omega}}_{t}^{s}(X_{t}-C_{t},P_{t},Q_{t})\\\end{eqnarray*}\section{The Last Period}In the last period of life, the consumer knows for certain that he will not be alive to consume in the next period.  The maximization problem then becomes:\begin{eqnarray*}	V_{T}(X_{T},P_{T},Q_{t}) & = & \max_{\{C_{t}\}}  u(C_{t}) + B(X_{t}-C_{t})  \\\end{eqnarray*}for which the FOC is\begin{eqnarray*}	u'(C_{T}) & = & B'(X_{T}-C_{T})  \\	C_{T}^{-\rho} & = & (X_{T}-C_{T}+\lambda)^{-\alpha}  \\	C_{T} & = & (X_{T}-C_{T}+\lambda)^{\alpha/\rho}\end{eqnarray*}The envelope theorem tells us that, for consumers who plan on leaving a positive bequest, \begin{eqnarray*}	\frac{dV_{T}}{dX_{T}} & = & \frac{\partial V_{T}}{\partial X_{T}}	+\frac{\partial V_{T}}{\partial C_{T}} \frac{\partial C_{T}}{\partial 	X_{T}}  \\	 & = & B'(X_{T})  \\\end{eqnarray*}\section{Scaling Issues}\begin{eqnarray*}	V(x) & = & \frac{x^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}  \\	W(x) & = & [(1-\rho)V(x)]^{1/(1-\rho)} \\	W'(x) &= & \frac{[(1-\rho)V(x)]^{1/(1-\rho) - 1}}{(1-\rho)} V'(x) 	(1-\rho)\\	      &= & [(1-\rho)V(x)]^{1/(1-\rho) - (1-\rho)/(1-\rho)}V'(x) \\	      &= & [(1-\rho)V(x)]^{\rho/(1-\rho)} V'(x) \\	      &= & [x^{1-\rho}]^{\rho/(1-\rho)} x^{-\rho} \\	      &= & x^{\rho}x^{-\rho} \\	      & =& 1\end{eqnarray*}\begin{eqnarray*}	V'(x) & = & x^{-\rho}  \\    V''(x) & = & (-\rho)x^{-\rho-1}  \\	U(x) & = & [V'(x)]^{1/-\rho} \\	U'(x) &= & \frac{[V'(x)]^{1/-\rho - 1}}{-\rho} V''(x) \\	      &= & \frac{[V'(x)]^{1/-\rho - (-\rho/-\rho)}}{-\rho} V''(x) \\	      &= & \frac{[V'(x)]^{(1+\rho)/-\rho}}{-\rho} V''(x) \\	      &= & \frac{[V'(x)]^{-(1+\rho)/\rho}}{-\rho} V''(x) \\	      &= & \frac{[x^{-\rho}]^{-(1+\rho)/\rho}}{-\rho} (-\rho)x^{-\rho - 1} \\	      &= & [x^{-\rho}]^{-(1+\rho)/\rho} x^{-(1+\rho)} \\	      & =& [x^{-1}]^{-(1+\rho)}x^{-(1+\rho)} \\	      & =& x^{(1+\rho)-(1+\rho)} \\	      & =& 1\end{eqnarray*}\section{Parametric Assumptions}\begin{tabular}{lcr}$\beta$ & - & .95 \end{tabular}}{} % End ifthenelse{ShowFirstStuff}\section{Useful Derivations}\subsection{Value Function In Second-To-Last Period of Life If Utility Comes Only From Wealth}Consider a consumer who obtains utility simply from holding wealth,\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(W_{t}) & = & \frac{W_{t}^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} + \beta E_{t}	V_{T}(W_{T}) \nonumber \\     & \mbox{such that} &  \nonumber \\	W_{T} & = & \hat{R}_{T} W_{t} \nonumber\end{eqnarray}where $\hat{R}_{T}$ is the (possibly stochastic) return on the wealth portfolio.

Suppose that the agent can choose to put a fraction $\omega$ of her portfolio in a risky asset which has stochastic gross return $\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$.  Suppose $\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1} \sim N(r_s,\sigma_{r_s}^{2})$.  Recall that for lognormally distributed variables we know that\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t} \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}& = & E_{t}[ \log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] + \frac{1}{2} 	\mbox{var}_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] \\	 & = & r_s + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}and so the overall return on the portfolio will be\begin{eqnarray*}	\hat{R}_{t+1} & = & (1-\omega) R + \omega \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}  \\	\hat{r}_{t+1} & = & (1-\omega) r + \omega \tilde{r}_{s,t+1} \\\end{eqnarray*}which can be approximated by\footnote{To see this, note that $\log R^{1-\omega}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega} = (1-\omega)\log R + \omega \log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ and recall that $\log R \approx r$, $\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1} \approx \tilde{r}_{s,t+1}$, and $\log \hat{R}_{t+1} \approx \hat{r}_{t+1}.$}\begin{eqnarray*}	\hat{R}_{t+1} & \approx & R^{1-\omega}\tilde{R}^{\omega}_{t+1}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The value-function-maximizing choice of $\omega$ will be the choice that minimizes $\gamma$ (recall that $W^{1-\alpha}/(1-\alpha)<0$) which will therefore be the $\omega$ that minimizes $E_{t}[ \hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$.\begin{eqnarray*}	E_{t}[ \hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}] & = & 	E_{t}[R^{(1-\omega)(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & R^{(1-\omega)(1-\alpha)}E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}]  \\\end{eqnarray*}But because $\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ is distributed lognormally \begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}] & = & E_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}] + \frac{1}{2}\mbox{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & \omega(1-\alpha) E_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] + 	 \frac{[\omega(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\mbox{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}]  \\	 & = & \omega(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[\omega(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}   \\\end{eqnarray*}Note that the choice of $\omega$ that minimizes $E_{t}\hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}$ will be identical with the choice that minimizes its log.  Thus the problem is to find the $\omega$ that minimizes\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}\hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}  & = & \log [R^{(1-\omega)(1-\alpha)} 	E_{t}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega(1-\alpha)}] \\    & = & (1-\omega)(1-\alpha) \log R + \omega(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[\omega(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}\\	 & = & (1-\alpha)r + \omega(1-\alpha) 	 (r_s-r) + \frac{[\omega(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The FOC is:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & (1-\alpha)(r_s-r) + 	[\omega(1-\alpha)](1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\	 & = & (r_s-r) + 	[\omega(1-\alpha)]\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\	\omega & = & 	\frac{-(r_s-r)}{(1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}}  \\	\omega & = & 	\frac{(r_s-r)}{(\alpha-1)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}}  \\\end{eqnarray*}If $\alpha>1$ then this expression has the intuitive implications that the share of the portfolio devoted to risky assets increases with the equity premium and decreases as consumers get more risk averse ($\alpha$ rises) or as the riskiness of the risky asset increases ($\sigma_{r_s}^{2}$ rises).  For moderate values of $\alpha$ like 3 and for reasonable values of the variance of lognormally distributed returns $\sigma_{r_s}^{2}$ this equation implies a value of $\omega>1$.  That is, consumers borrow at the riskless rate in order to invest in the risky asset.  For example, suppose that the equity premium $r_s-r = .05$ and suppose that the standard deviation of annual stock returns is $\sigma_{r_s} = .15$ implying $\sigma_{r_s}^{2} = .0225$.  Then for $\alpha=3$ this equation yields $\omega = -.05/(-2*.0225) = 1.111\ldots$; that is, over 100 percent of the portfolio is placed in the risky asset.\subsection{Portfolio Choice Between a Safe and Two Risky Assets}\begin{eqnarray*}	\hat{R}_{t+1} & \approx & R^{(1-\omega_{s}-\omega_{k})}\tilde{R}^{\omega_{s}}_{t+1}\tilde{R}^{\omega_{k}}_{t+1}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The value-function-maximizing choice of $(\omega_{s},\omega_{k})$ will be the choices that minimize $E_{t}[ \hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$.\begin{eqnarray*}	E_{t}[ \hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}] & = & 	E_{t}[R^{(1-\omega_{s}-\omega_{k})(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{\omega_{k}(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & R^{(1-\omega_{s}-\omega_{k})(1-\alpha)}     E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{\omega_{k}(1-\alpha)}]  \\\end{eqnarray*}If we assume that $\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ and $\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}$ are distributed lognormally and independently of each other, we have\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)}] & = & E_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)}] + \frac{1}{2}\mbox{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & \omega_{i}(1-\alpha) E_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{i,t+1}] + 	 \frac{[\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\mbox{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}]  \\	 & = & \omega_{i}(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_i}^{2}   \\\end{eqnarray*}for $i \in \{s,k\}$.Note that the combination of $(\omega_{s},\omega_{k})$ that minimizes $E_{t}\hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}$ will be identical with the choice that minimizes its log.  Thus the problem is to find the $(\omega_{s},\omega_{k})$ that minimize\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}\hat{R}_{t+1}^{1-\alpha} & = & \log [R^{(1-\omega_{s}-\omega_{k})(1-\alpha)} 	E_{t}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{\omega_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{\omega_{k}(1-\alpha)}] \\	 & = & (1-\alpha)r 	 + \omega_{s}(1-\alpha) (r_s-r) + \frac{[\omega_{s}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  	 + \omega_{k}(1-\alpha) (r_k-r) + \frac{[\omega_{k}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_k}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The FOC with respect to $\omega_{i}$ for $i \in \{s,k\}$ is:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & (1-\alpha)(r_i-r) + 	[\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)](1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}  \\	 & = & (r_i-r) + [\omega_{i}(1-\alpha)]\sigma_{r_i}^{2}  \\	\omega_{i} & = & \frac{-(r_i-r)}{(1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}}  \\	\omega_{i} & = & \frac{(r_i-r)}{(\alpha-1)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}}  \\\end{eqnarray*}This formula provides a useful way to parameterize the problem, because as $W \rightarrow \infty$ the consumers in our model in the limit derive all of their utility from wealth, so we should expect their behavior in the limit to resemble that of agents like those defined in equation ($\ref{eq:wealthutil}$).  If we observe values for $\omega_{r_{s}}$ and $\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}$ we can calculate the value of $\alpha$ which would be consistent with those observations:\begin{eqnarray*}	\alpha & = & 1 + \frac{r_{s}-r}{\omega_{s}\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}\end{eqnarray*}Consider first the rich households who are not engaged in entrepreneurial activity.  Averaging across our four datasets, the observed value of $\omega_{s}$ for these households is roughly 0.7.  Our baseline assumption about the process for the stock marketyields a value of $\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2} \approx .07$.  This yields an estimate of\begin{eqnarray*}	\alpha & = & 1 + \frac{.035}{0.7*.07} \\	 & = & 1.7\end{eqnarray*}If take the richest 1/2 percent of the consumers in our datasets as reflecting a close approximation to $W = \infty$, the appropriate sample values to match are roughly $\omega_{k} = .5$, $\omega_{s} = .25$.  This implies that we must make assumptions such that \begin{eqnarray*}	\frac{\omega_{s}}{\omega_{k}} & = & .5  \\	 & = & \frac{(r_{s}-r)/\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}{(r_{k}-r)/\sigma_{r_{k}}^{2}} \\	 & = & \left(\frac{r_{s}-r}{r_{k}-r}\right)\left(\frac{\sigma_{r_{k}}^{2}}{\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}\right)\end{eqnarray*}\end{document}Furthermore, casual scrutiny of the {\it Forbes 400} list reveals that most of the wealthiest people in the world made their wealth primarily or exclusively from one enterprise or a set of closely connected enterprises, so it seems reasonable to impose.Quadrini form:In each period there is some probability that a given household will have the opportunity to enter the business sector.

Thus the consumer learns the value of $\zeta_{t}$, the transitory shock to labor income, $\eta_{t}$ the permanent shock to labor income, and the values for $R_{t}^{s}$, the gross return on stocks purchased in the previous period, and $R_{t}^{k}$, the gross return on the entrepreneurial project (if any) in which the household invested in the previous period.  We assume that the net return on the entrepreneurial project is given by $R_{t}^{k}Q_{t+1} \Omega(\omega_{t-1}^{k})$ where $\Omega$ is a function that scales down the return on the entrepreneurial project to an extent determined by the fraction of the household's portfolio that is invested in the project.  If the entire portfolio is invested in the project ($\omega_{t-1}^{k}=1$) then $\Omega(1)=1$ and the household reaps the full return.  If a smaller fraction of the portfolio is invested, the return is proportionately lower.In order to start an entrepreneurial venture, a household who is not currently engaged in an entrepreneurial project must have an `idea,' an event that occurs randomly with probability $p=.05$ at the beginning of each year.  The household then must choose whether to implement the idea by investing a positive fraction of its portfolio in the entrepreneurial project, or to remain a worker.  We the presence or absence of The expected value of wealth that is not consumed in the present period is given by the discounted value if the consumer is alive in the next period (and event with probability $(1-d_{t+1})$ plus the value they attach to the bequest they will leave behind in the event of death.  Denote total household resources at the beginning of period $t$ by $X_{t}$, household noncapital income by $Y_{t}$, the rate of return on stocks as $R_{t}^{s}$ and the share of the household portfolio in stocks is designated $\omega_{t}^{s}$.  The return on the entrepreneurial project depends on the proportion of the household portfolio invested in the project.

Roughly 40 percent of entrepreneurial projects fail in the first year, but the failure rate of projects which have survived for three years or longer is only about 10 percent.  We capture this phenomenon by making the stochastic rate of return on entreprenurial projects $R_{t+1}^{k}$ a function of $Q_{t}$.  For `new' projects there is a 40 percent chance that $R_{t+1}^{k} = 0$ while for `mature' projects the probability of failure is only 10 percent.
