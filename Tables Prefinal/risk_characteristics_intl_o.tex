For mutual funds and defined contribution pension accounts that contain a mix of safe and risky assets, the SCF does not obtain information on the respective shares of the different categories of assets, and so we include these in the "Risk Characteristics Unknown" category.  Other assets in this category include managed investment trusts whose investment strategy is mixed or unknown, `other financial assets' (such as oil and gas leases,royalties, [Kevin fill in]), and [Kevin fill in].
