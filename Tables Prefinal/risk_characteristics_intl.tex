For mutual funds and defined contribution pension accounts that contain a mix of safe and risky assets, the SCF does not obtain information on the respective shares of the different categories of assets, and so we include these in the "Risk Characteristics Unknown" category.  Other assets in this category include other managed assets whose investment strategy is mixed or unknown, `other financial assets' (such as oil and gas leases,royalties, deferred compensation, and future proceeds from lawsuits).
