Because riskyassets generate larger expected returns than the risk free asset,risk-averse households must determine the best compromise between risk andexpected return. In a static framework, this problem is usually formalizedby introducing a concave utility function on final consumption.\ Under thestandard axioms of decision under uncertainty (von Neumann-Morgenstern(1944)), households will select the portfolio which maximizes the expectedutility of their final consumption. The degree of concavity of the utility,as defined by Arrow (1971) and Pratt (1964), \ characterizes their degree ofabsolute risk aversion.\ It can be measured by answering to questionnairesrelated to risk choices.\ When this information is combined with thespecific distribution of returns of financial assets, one can compute theoptimal portfolio of the household. An increase in the absolute riskaversion reduces the demand for risky assets. This mechanism is wellunderstood and is included in most textbooks in market finance.I am tempted to say that this is also the only mechanism that is wellunderstood \ in this field. For example, important progresses have been madein the late sixties by introducing time into the portfolio strategies.Usually, households have long term objectives as retirement when they investin financial markets. How does long horizon affect the optimal structure ofthe portfolio?\ Said differently, how does the option to purchase stockstomorrow modify the attitude towards portfolio risk today? The pathbreakingpapers of Mossin (1968), Merton (1969) and Samuelson (1969) did answer tothis question in a very simple but intriguing way: the intrinsically dynamicstructure of portfolio management has no effect the solution to theproblem.\ Under their assumptions, the sequence of portfolio structures thatare statically optimal is also dynamically optimal.\ In other words,households should do as if each period of investment is the last periodbefore retirement. Myopia is optimal.\ The econometrician should not use ageas an explanatory variable for households' portfolios. But it is oftenforgot that this result holds only under very restrictive conditions on theutility function. Namely, myopia is optimal only if the utility functionexhibits constant relative risk aversion. In this paper, we explain why thisis the case and under which condition households who can invest longer inrisky assets should invest more in them.Household portfolios do not only serve long term objectives as financingretirement.\ An important share of savings are invested in liquid funds thatplay the role of buffer stocks. \ When they have been lucky on theirprevious investments, they can reduce their saving rate to cash immediatelythe benefits of the larger-than-expected portfolio returns.\ They can alsoincrease their saving rate in case of an adverse shock on portfolio returns.This means that households do not bear the accumulated lifetime portfoliorisk at the time of retirement.\ Rather, they can disseminate this risk overtheir lifetime consumption pattern. This allows for some forms of timediversification through consumption smoothing. This is a strong incentive toaccept riskier portfolios. The implications for the econometrician is atestable hypothesis: households who can adapt over time their contributionsto their pension funds do select riskier portfolio structures.Two other factors will have important implications on household portfolios.\First, the presence of a liquidity constraint on the consumption-savingstrategy should be taken into account to design portfolio strategies.\Indeed, this liquidity constraint, if it binds, will eliminate thepossibility to transfer capital risks over time through consumptionsmoothing. It will induce a more conservative portfolio management for thosehouseholds that are more likely to face a binding liquidity constraint inthe future. Second, most risk borne by households are not portfolio risksbut uninsurable risks affecting their human capital.\ The intuition suggeststhat households bearing a larger risk on their human capital should investless in risky assets.\ We examine all these factors influencing the optimal portfolio composition.We present each factor in isolation in a simplified model which excludes theother factors. We hope that this will help the reader to understand thenature of this factor without hiding the ''big picture''. The analysis ofhow these factors can be combined is let for the calibrations that will bepresented in various chapters of this book. Section 2 is devoted to thepresentation of the static portfolio problem under uncertainty. It will beuseful for the remaining of the paper to observe that this problem issymmetric to the dynamic consumption problem under certainty. In section 3,we derive the main properties of the optimal static portfolio. The effect ofbackground risk is examined in section 4, whereas the repeated nature ofportfolio management is examined in section 5. The notion of timediversification is developed in section 6.\ Finally, we examine the effectof the liquidity constraint in section 7 before providing some concludingremarks.\section{The basic model and its applications}Most of the paper deals with the properties of the following model: \begin{equation}\max_{C_{1},...,C_{N}}\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}u(C_{i})  \label{1}\end{equation}\begin{equation}s.t.\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\pi _{i}C_{i}=X,  \label{2}\end{equation}where $(p_{1},...,p_{N})$ and $(\pi _{1},...,\pi _{N})$ are two vectors ofnonnegative scalars and $u$ is a real-valued, increasing and concavefunction. Notice that the only specificity of this model with respect to thevery basic problem of consumer theory \ under certainty is the additivity ofthe objective function. Under the concavity of $u$, the necessary andsufficient condition for program (\ref{1}) under constraint (\ref{2}) iswritten as \begin{equation}u^{\prime }(C_{i})=\xi \pi _{i},\quad \quad i=1,...,N,  \label{foc}\end{equation}where $\xi $ is the Lagrangian multiplier associated to the constraint.There are three standard applications of this decision problem ineconomics.\ The first one is related to the efficient allocation of risk ina pool of $N$ risk-averse agents. This topic is not directly related toportfolio decisions and will not be covered in this paper. The secondapplication of program (\ref{1}) is the static portfolio problem of arisk-averse investor in an Arrow-Debreu economy. More specifically, consideran economy in which investors live for one period.\ At the beginning of theperiod, the investor under scrutiny is endowed with a sure wealth $X$. Hedoes not know the state of the world that will prevail at the end of theperiod.\ There are $N$ states of the world indexed by $i$, $i=1,...,N$. Theuncertainty is described by the probability $p_{i}$ that state $i$ occurs,with $\sum_{i}p_{i}=1$. Consumption takes place only after that therealization of $i$ is observed. The agent invests his endowment in aportfolio of assets that will be liquidated at the end of the period tofinance consumption. We assume that financial markets are complete. Itimplies that for each state $i$, there exists an associated state price (perunit of probability) $\pi _{i}\geq 0$. In other words, the agent must pay $%p_{i}\pi _{i}$ at the beginning of the period to increase his consumption byone unit in state $i$. Vector $(C_{1},...,C_{N})$ is the state-contingentconsumption plan \ of the agent, and equation (\ref{2}) is the budgetconstraint of the investor. This vector can also be seen as a portfolio ofArrow-Debreu securities. The objective function in (\ref{1}) is the ex anteexpected utility of the investor who selects this portfolio. Thisapplication has been intensively used in the theory of finance during thelast three decades.\ In this presentation, we assumed that the agent had no income ex-post.Introducing state-contingent incomes is not a problem when markets arecomplete. Indeed, $X$ can also be seen as the ex ante market value of thesestate-contingent incomes, i.e., $X=\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}Y_{i}$ where $Y_{i}$is the household's income in state $i$. This is the main feature of marketscompleteness, as agents can transfer their individual risks to the market.The last application of program (\ref{1}) is the lifetime consumption-savingproblem under certainty. Consider a household who lives for $N$ periods,from period $i=1$ to period $i=N$. There is no uncertainty about the netpresent value of his incomes. The household's net discounted wealth at thebeginning of period $i=1$ equals $X$. Vector $(C_{1},...,C_{N})$ representsthe time-dependent consumption plan, with $C_{i}$ measuring consumption inperiod $i$. The objective function is to maximize the discounted utility ofconsumption over the lifetime of the household.\ Parameter $p_{i}$ in (\ref{1}) is the discount factor associated to period $i$.\ It is often assumedthat $p_{i}=\beta ^{i}$, to escape problems of time-consistency in decisionmaking. People can finance their consumption in period $i$ by purchasing inperiod $1$ zero-coupon bonds maturing in period $i$. The gross rate ofreturn of such a bond is denoted $(p_{i}\pi _{i})^{-1}$. Constraint (\ref{2}%) is the household's lifetime budget constraint. Program (\ref{1}) has beena cornerstone of the literature on the Permanent Income Hypothesis inmacroeconomics.In spite of their technical equivalence, these two problems are different innature. For example, the concavity of the utility function represents riskaversion in the portfolio problem, whereas it implies aversion toconsumption fluctuations in the consumption-saving problem. \ It means atthe same time that the agent is willing to perfectly insure risks ifinsurance prices are fair ($\pi _{i}=1$ for all $i$), and that he is willingto smooth consumption over time if the return on bonds equals the rate ofimpatience. This aversion to fluctuations of consumption across time orstates is measured by the Arrow-Pratt index of absolute aversion, which isdefined by $A(C)=-u^{\prime \prime }(C)/u^{\prime }(C)$. It is moreconvenient in general to use an index of relative aversion, $\rho(C)=CA(C)=-Cu^{\prime \prime }(C)/u^{\prime }(C).$ In the consumption-savingproblem, $\rho $ is the inverse of the well-known elasticity ofintertemporal substitution.These dual interpretations of the theoretical model suggest two ways toestimate $\rho $. Viewing it as a degree of risk aversion, one can estimateit by answering to the following question: What is the share of one's wealththat one is ready to pay to escape the risk of gaining or losing a share $%\alpha $ of it with equal probability? Let $x$ be this (certaintyequivalent) share of wealth. Suppose that the agent has constant relativerisk aversion (CRRA), which implies that \begin{equation}u(C)=\dfrac{C^{1-\rho }}{1-\rho }.  \label{CRRA}\end{equation}Normalizing wealth to unity,\footnote{%With constant relative risk aversion, the certainty \ equivalent share $x$is independent of initial wealth.} it implies that $x$ is the solution ofthe following equation:\begin{equation}0.5\frac{(1-\alpha )^{1-\rho }}{1-\rho }+0.5\frac{(1+\alpha )^{1-\rho }}{%1-\rho }=\frac{(1-x)^{1-\rho }}{1-\rho }.  \label{x}\end{equation}Table 1 relates $x$ to $\rho $, when $\alpha =10$\% or $\alpha =30$\%.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hlineRRA & $\alpha =10\%$ & $\alpha =30\%$ \\ \hline$\rho =0.5$ & 0.3\% & 2.3\% \\ \hline$\rho =1$ & 0.5\% & 4.6\% \\ \hline$\rho =4$ & 2.0\% & 16.0\% \\ \hline$\rho =10$ & 4.4\% & 24.4\% \\ \hline$\rho =40$ & 8.4\% & 28.7\% \\ \hline\end{tabular}Table 1: Relative certainty equivalent loss $x$ associated to the risk ofgaining or losing a share $\alpha $ of wealth, with constant relative riskaversion $\rho $.\end{center}If we focus on the risk of gaining or losing $10\%$ of one's wealth, wewould consider an answer $x=0.5\%,...,2\%$ as a sensible answer to thequestion. It implies that it is reasonable to believe that relative riskaversion is somewhere between 1 and 4.\ Saying it differently, a relativerisk aversion superior to 10 seems foolish, as it implies very high relativerisk premiums.\ Notice in particular that a relative risk aversion of 40\implies that one would be ready to pay as much as 8.4\% to escape the riskof gaining or losing 10\% of one's wealth!The other approach is to see $\rho $ as the degree of relative aversion toconsumption fluctuations. \ Consider an agent who consumes income $1-\alpha $in each even year, and $1+\alpha $ in each odd year. He is offered to smoothhis consumption by paying a premium $x$ on his average income. What is thecritical value of $x$ which makes the agent indifferent between the twoconsumption plans? Under CRRA, the relationship between $x$, $\rho $ and $%\alpha $ is governed by exactly the same formula (\ref{x}).\footnote{%To be exact, one of the two terms in the left-hand side of equation (\ref{x}%) should be multiplied by rate of impatience, depending upon whether westart with an even year or an odd year.} Looking at Table 1, an interval $%\left[ 1,4\right] $ for \ the degree of relative aversion to consumptionfluctuations over time seems to be reasonable. Barsky, Juster, Kimball andShapiro (1997) used experimental data from the Health and Retirement Studyin the U.S. to measure risk aversion and aversion to consumptionfluctuations for people above 50 of age. They reported values of $\rho $that are slightly larger than those suggested here.The beauty and the simplicity of the above model come from the additivity ofthe objective function with respect to states of the world or time,depending upon which application we have in mind. All nice properties thatwe will report in the remaining of this chapter will be derived from thisadditive hypothesis. In the case of risk, we know that this hypothesis canbe derived from a more fundamental axiom, i.e., the independence axiom. Asimilar axiom can be built to derive an additive property for preferenceswith respect to time. We also know that the independence axiom has a weakpredictive power in some specific risky situations, mainly those involvinglow probabilities. A branch of the economics of uncertainty provides moregeneral (non-additive) decision criteria to deal with these specific cases.A similar step has been made in the economics of time, withnon-time-additive models. Those involving habit formations seem to be quitepromising, but will not be examined in this paper (see for exampleConstantinides (1990)).Another problem arises when we try to mix risk and time. When futureconsumption levels are uncertain, the objective function is usually definedas the {\it discounted expected} lifetime utility. This implies that theutility function represents at the same time the attitude towards risk andthe attitude towards time of the decision maker. But imagine an agent thatdoes not give the same $x$ when answering to the two questions mentionedabove. This agent may not have the discounted expected lifetime utility asan objective function.\ Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Selden (1978) suggesteda model \ that would disentangle the degree of risk aversion from the degreeof aversion to consumption fluctuations. In this model, the additivityacross states in each period is preserved, together with the additivityacross period in each state.\ But the additivity in the full space (risk,time) is not preserved, contrary to what we have with the discountedexpected utility model. Again, we will not cover this generalization in thischapter.\ Applications of Kreps-Porteus preferences in macroeconomics areexplored by Weil (1990).\section{The standard static portfolio problem\label{standardsec}}After this discussion about the basic\ decision model (\ref{1}), it is nowtime to explore the main features of its solution. We do this with the riskapplication in mind.\ We consider an agent who lives for one period and whohas to invest his endowment $X$ in a portfolio that will be liquidated atthe end of the period to finance his final consumption. Of course, thismodel is completely unrealistic because it is static, and because we assumemarket completeness. This model is considered as a benchmark, and will beextended to include dynamic strategies and markets incompleteness insubsequent sections.First-order condition (\ref{foc}) holding in each possible state, it mustalso hold in expectation.\ This condition is written as \begin{equation}Eu^{\prime }(\widetilde{C})=\xi E\widetilde{\pi }=\dfrac{\xi }{R},  \label{3}\end{equation}where $E\widetilde{z}=\sum_{i}p_{i}z_{i}$ is the expectation operator and $R=%\left[ E\widetilde{\pi }\right] ^{-1}$ is the gross risk free rate. Indeed,an asset guaranteeing one unit of consumption with certainty at the end ofthe period costs $\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}=E\widetilde{\pi }$ at the beginningof the period. Multiplying both sides of equality (\ref{foc}) by $c_{i}$,taking the expectation and using conditions (\ref{2}) and (\ref{3}) alsoyields \begin{equation}E\widetilde{C}u^{\prime }(\widetilde{C})=RXEu^{\prime }(\widetilde{C})\label{4}\end{equation}Let us assume that a Two-fund Separation result holds here, i.e., that it isoptimal for the agent to limit his choice to the allocation of his endowmentbetween two specific funds of assets.\ The first fund is risk free withgross return $R$.\ The second fund is the set of all risky assets, or''stocks'', of the economy. Its excess return over the risk free rate isdenoted $\widetilde{R}_{s}$. Let $\alpha $ denote the share of the initialendowment that is invested in the stock fund. The final consumption in thiscase equals $\widetilde{C}=X(R+\alpha \widetilde{R}_{s})$. \ The optimalshare $\alpha $ of wealth invested in stocks is then obtained by rewritingcondition (\ref{4}) as \begin{equation}E\widetilde{R}_{s}u^{\prime }(X(R+\alpha \widetilde{R}_{s}))=0.  \label{5}\end{equation}What do we know about the properties of the optimal share of wealth invested\ risky assets as a function of the parameters of the problem? Withoutentering into the details of the proofs which can be found for example inEeckhoudt and Gollier (1995), we know the following three properties of theoptimal $\alpha :$\begin{itemize}\item  If $E\widetilde{R}_{s}>0$, it is optimal to invest in the stock fund (%$\alpha >0);$\item  Consider two agents with an identical initial endowment $X$, butrespectively with utility function $u$ and $v$. Individual $u$ invests lessin the risky fund than individual $v$, at all levels of $X$ and for anydistribution of $\widetilde{R}_{s}$, if and only if $u$ is more risk-aversethan $v$ in the sense of Arrow-Pratt, i.e., if $-u^{\prime \prime}(C)/u^{\prime }(C)$ is larger than $-v^{\prime \prime }(C)/v^{\prime }(C)$for all $C$.\item  An increase in initial wealth $X$ always increases the optimal shareinvested in the risky fund, for any distribution of $\widetilde{R}_{s}$, ifand only if the index of relative risk aversion $\rho (C)$ is decreasing in $%C$.\end{itemize}These are clear-cut properties.\ The third one in particular is anhypothesis on preferences that can be tested with data about householdportfolios. The first result is contradicted by the observation that a largeproportion of the population does not hold any risky asset.\ This may be dueto the existence of a participation cost to financial markets. Notice alsothat there is an important literature on the effect of a change in thedistribution of excess returns on the demand for stocks. Contrary to theintuition, it is not true in general that a first-order stochasticallydominated shift in distribution of returns, or also a Rothschild-Stiglitzincrease in risk in returns, does not necessarily reduce the demand forstocks. This literature did not provide any testable property of optimalportfolio strategies and will therefore not be covered here.\footnote{%Gollier (1995) obtained the necessary and sufficient condition on the changeof distribution for a reduction in the demand for stocks by all risk-averseinvestors.}We can also estimate the optimal $\alpha $ by calibrating the model.Assuming the lognormality of the distribution of $\widetilde{R}_{s}$together with the constancy of relative risk aversion $\rho $, it can beshown that \ the solution of equation (\ref{5}) is \begin{equation}\alpha =R\dfrac{E\widetilde{R}_{s}}{\sigma _{s}^{2}}\dfrac{1}{\rho },\label{6}\end{equation}where $\sigma _{s}^{2}$ is the variance of $\widetilde{R}_{s}$. Condition (%\ref{6}) can also be obtained without lognormality and CRRA, but by assumingthat the portfolio risk is small. In that case, a first-order Taylorexpansion of $u^{\prime }(X(R+\alpha R_{s}))$ around $RX$ in equation (\ref{5}) directly yields (\ref{6}$)$ as an approximation.Historically, the equity premium $E\widetilde{R}_{s}$ has been around $6\%$per year over the century in U.S. markets.\footnote{%These summary statistics are from Kocherlakota (1996).}\ The standarddeviation of yearly U.S. stock returns over the same period equals $16\%$.The real risk free rate $R-1$ averaged at $1\%$ per year. Combining thisinformation with formula (\ref{6}) yields an optimal relative share ofwealth invested in risky assets that equals \ $220\%$ and $55\%$respectively for a relative risk aversion of $1$ and $4$.\ This very largeshares with respect to observed portfolio compositions by U.S.\ householdsis commonly referred to as the Equity Premium Puzzle, as introduced by Mehraand Prescott (1985). A more standard way to present this puzzle is asfollows: in order to explain actual portfolio composition in the U.S., oneneeds to assume a degree of relative risk aversion around 40 for therepresentative agent.\ From our discussion about the level of $\rho $, thisis highly implausible. Kocherlakota (1996) provides a survey about thepotential ways to solve the puzzle.Equations (\ref{5}) and (\ref{6}) have been obtained under the assumptionthat all households invest in the same two funds.\ In particular, thestructure of the portfolio of stocks is fixed. Since Wilson (1968), we knowthat this is the case at equilibrium only for utility functions exhibitingharmonic absolute risk aversion (HARA). Absolute risk aversion is harmonicif its inverse is linear, i.e., if $\left[ A(C)\right] ^{-1}=-u^{\prime}(C)/u^{\prime \prime }(C)$ is linear in $C$. This is the case forlogarithmic, power and exponential utility functions. When utility functionsare not HARA, some agents will prefer to overinvest in some specific riskyassets that they find underrepresented in the stock fund. For example, someagents may engage in portfolio insurance schemes by purchasing call optionson stocks. It implies that $C$ would not anymore be linear in the overallreturn $\widetilde{R}_{s}$ of the economy, contrary to the specification $%C(R_{s})=X(R+\alpha R_{s})$.\footnote{%Leland (1980) determines the characteristics of agents who should purchasecall option on the aggregate risk in the economy.} The simplicity of theTwo-Fund Separation hypothesis is to fully describe the portfolio by asingle variable, $\alpha $. A complete description of optimal portfolioswhen the Two-fund separation result does not hold requires us to solve thesystem of equation (\ref{2}), (\ref{foc})$.$ The effect of a change in therisk attitude of the investor is similar to what we stated in the two-fundcase, but this requires to be more cautious about what we mean by a morerisky portfolio.\section{The optimal static portfolio composition with background risk\label%{RVsec}}Up to now, we assumed that the only source of risk faced by the household isthe portfolio risk. This is far from realistic, since most of the observedvolatility of households' earnings comes from variations in labour incomes.Typically, risks related to human capital cannot be traded on Wall Street.\And financial intermediaries like insurers are not willing to underwritesuch risks mainly because of moral hazard. Unemployment insurance isineffective in most countries.\ This is particularly true for risks of longterm unemployment, which is one of the central concerns of middle classhouseholds in Europe. Thus, it appears to be important to adapt the basicportfolio problem to include an uninsurable background risk. The question ishow does the presence of a risk on human capital affect the demand forstocks.We will assume that the risk on human capital is independent of theportfolio risk.\ This is clearly unrealistic.\ Most shocks to the economyaffect in the same direction the marginal productivity of labour (wages) andthe marginal productivity of capital (portfolio returns). It implies thathuman capital is usually positively correlated with assets value. Butallowing for statistical dependence is not a problem.\ In particular, apositive correlation makes human capital substitute for stocks. Therefore,an increase in the correlation will reduce the demand for stocks. It remainsto treat the independence case.The intuition is strong to suggest that independent risks are substitutes.\We mean by this that the presence of one risk reduces the demand for otherindependent risks. This would mean that background risks have a temperingeffect on the demand for stocks. Households that are subject to a larger(mean-preserving) uncertainty about their future labour incomes should bemore conservative on their portfolio.Our theoretical model to treat this question is quite simple.\ Consider anagent with utility $u$ on his final consumption. He is endowed with capital $%X$ at the beginning of the period, which can be invested in Arrow-Debreusecurities as in the previous section. What is new here is that the finalwealth of the agent equals the sum of the value of his portfolio and hislabour income.\ Because the risk free part of this income has been included,discounted, in $X$, we assume that this added has a zero mean.\ Thisbackground risk is denoted $\widetilde{\varepsilon }$ and is independent ofthe state of the world $i$. The portfolio problem is \ now written as \begin{equation}\max_{C_{1},...,C_{N}}\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}Eu(C_{i}+\widetilde{%\varepsilon }),\end{equation}subject to the unchanged budget constraint (\ref{2}).Let us define indirect utility function $v$, with $v(Z)=Eu(Z+\widetilde{%\varepsilon })$ for all $Z$. In consequence, the above problem can berewritten as \begin{equation}\max_{C_{1},...,C_{N}}\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}v(C_{i}),\end{equation}subject to (\ref{2}). We conclude that the introduction of an independentbackground risk is equivalent to the transformation of the original utilityfunction $u$ into the indirect utility function $v$.\ This change in theattitude towards portfolio risks can be signed if and only if the degree ofconcavity of these two functions can be ranked in the sense of Arrow-Pratt.More specifically, the intuition that the background risk affects negativelythe demand for stocks would be sustained by the theory if $v$ is moreconcave than $u$. Technically, this means that \begin{equation}E\widetilde{\varepsilon }=0\quad \Longrightarrow \quad \dfrac{-Eu^{\prime\prime }(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })}{Eu^{\prime }(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon }%)}\geq \dfrac{-u^{\prime \prime }(C)}{u^{\prime }(C)}  \label{RV}\end{equation}for all $C$ and $\widetilde{\varepsilon }$. This property does not hold ingeneral. All utility functions which satisfy \ property (\ref{RV}) are saidto be ''risk vulnerable'', to follow a terminology introduced by Gollier andPratt (1996). Using Taylor approximations, it is easy to prove that thisproperty holds for small risks if and only if \begin{equation}A^{\prime \prime }(C)\geq 2A^{\prime }(C)A(C),\end{equation}where $A(C)=-u^{\prime \prime }(C)/u^{\prime }(C)$ is absolute riskaversion. A simple sufficient condition for risk vulnerability is that $A$be decreasing and convex.\ Because the proof of this result is simple, wereproduce it here.\ The left-hand condition in (\ref{RV}) can be rewrittenas \begin{equation}EA(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })u^{\prime }(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })\geqA(C)Eu^{\prime }(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })\end{equation}But a decreasing and convex function $A$ implies that \begin{equation}EA(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })u^{\prime }(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })\geq %\left[ EA(C+\widetilde{\varepsilon })\right] \left[ Eu^{\prime }(C+%\widetilde{\varepsilon })\right] \geq A(C)Eu^{\prime }(C+\widetilde{%\varepsilon }).  \label{7}\end{equation}This is what we had to prove.\ The first inequality in (\ref{7}) comes fromthe fact that both $A$ and $u^{\prime }$ are decreasing in $\varepsilon $.The second inequality is an application of Jensen's inequality, togetherwith $A^{\prime \prime }\geq 0$ and $E\widetilde{\varepsilon }=0$.Observe that the classically used power utility function (\ref{CRRA}) has adecreasing and convex absolute risk aversion, since $A(C)=\rho /C$. Ourconclusion is that the introduction of a background risk in the calibrationof household portfolios will imply a rebalancement towards the risk freeasset.\section{The optimal dynamic portfolio composition with complete markets%\label{repeated}}One of the main deficiencies of the standard portfolio problem that weexamined in section \ref{standardsec} comes from the fact that it is static.Technically, it is descriptive of the situation of an agent who invests hiswealth in prospect of his retirement that will take place in one year. Inthis section, we will examine the optimal portfolio composition for peoplewho have more periods to go before retirement.\ In other words, we willexamine the relationship between portfolio risk and time horizon.In the formal literature, the horizon-riskiness issue has received thegreatest attention addressing portfolios appropriate to age. Samuelson(1989) and several others have asked: ``As you grow older and yourinvestment horizon shortens, should you cut down your exposure to lucrativebut risky equities?''Conventional wisdom answers affirmatively, stating thatlong-horizon investors can tolerate more risk because they have more time torecoup transient losses. This dictum has not received the imprimatur ofscience, however. As Samuelson (1963, 1989) in particular points out, this``time-diversification'' argument relies on a fallacious interpretation ofthe Law of Large Numbers: repeating an investment pattern over many periodsdoes not cause risk to wash out in the long run. In the next section, weexamine an alternative concept of time diversification.To address this question, \ we consider the problem of an agent who has tomanage a portfolio over time in order to maximize the expected utility ofhis consumption at retirement.\ In this section, we abstract ourself fromthe consumption-saving problem by assuming that this portfolio is specificfor retirement and that it cannot be used for consumption before retirement.Also, we normalize the risk free rate to zero.\ This implies that a youngand an old investor with the same discounted wealth today can secure thesame level of consumption at retirement by investing in the riskless asset.\If the risk free rate would be positive, the younger investor wouldimplicitly be wealthier.We can now understand why the age of the investor has an ambiguous effect onthe optimal portfolio composition. Contrary to the old investor, the youngagent has an option to invest in stocks in the subsequent periods. Thisoption has a positive value, which makes the younger agent implicitlywealthier, at least on average.\ Under decreasing absolute risk aversion(DARA), that makes him less risk-averse.\ This wealth effect affectspositively the share of wealth invested in stocks. But taking a risk has notthe same comparative statics effect than getting its expected net payoff forsure, as stressed in section \ref{RVsec}. The fact that the younger agentwill take a portfolio risk in the future plays the role of a background riskwith respect to his portfolio choice problem when he is young. This riskeffect goes the opposite direction than the wealth effect, under riskvulnerability. All this is made more complex by the dynamic aspect of theproblem, in the sense that the portfolio risk that the young will take inthe future can be made contingent to the accumulated portfolio value inprevious periods.It is standard to solve this kind of dynamic problem by using backwardinduction. Let $T$ denote the number of periods before retirement. Becausewe assumed that the only decision maker's concern is the welfare of theinvestor at the time of retirement, the objective is to maximize $Eu(%\widetilde{C}_{T})$. Assuming complete markets against all risks occurringduring the last period, the problem of the decision maker is exactly thesame as problem (\ref{1}), (\ref{2}). Denoting $X_{T-1}$ for the wealth thathas been accumulated at the beginning of the last period, this problem isrewritten as \begin{equation}V_{T-1}(X_{T-1})=\max_{C_{1T},...,C_{NT}}\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}u(C_{iT})\label{VT-1}\end{equation}\begin{equation}s.t.\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\pi _{i}C_{iT}=X_{T-1}\end{equation}where $C_{iT}$ is the demand for the Arrow-Debreu security associated tostate $i$. Because we assume that there is no serial correlation in assetreturns and that the random walk of returns is stationary, we did notindexed \ state prices $\pi _{i}$ and probabilities $p_{i}$ by $T$. Inshort, financial risks are assumed to be the same at each period. Again,with a negative serial correlation in assets returns, investing in stocks inthe future may serve as a partial insurance for portfolio risks takentoday.\ This would provide an additional incentive for young investors toraise the share of their wealth invested in stocks. We do not consider thispossibility here.Equation (\ref{VT-1}) introduced the (Bellman) value function $V_{T-1}$ intothe picture. $V_{T-1}(X_{T-1})$ is the maximum expected utility ofconsumption at retirement that can be obtained when the householdaccumulated a capital $X_{T-1}$ at the end of period $T-1$. Then, theportfolio problem at the beginning of period $T-1$ when the accumulatedcapital at that date is $X_{T-2}$ can be written as \begin{equation}V_{T-2}(X_{T-2})=\max_{X_{1T-1},...,X_{NT-1}}\quad\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}V_{T-1}(X_{iT-1})  \label{VT-2}\end{equation}\begin{equation}s.t.\quad \sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{i}\pi _{i}X_{iT-1}=X_{T-2}\end{equation}where $X_{iT-1}$ is at the same time the demand at $T-1$ for theArrow-Debreu security associated to state $i$ and the accumulated capital atthe end of period $T-1$ if state $i$ occurs. The optimal portfolio strategyin period $T-1$ is to find a portfolio which maximizes the expected value $%V_{T-1}$ (which is itself the maximal expected utility of final consumption)of the accumulated wealth at the end of the period. This will generate adynamic portfolio strategy that is optimal, in the sense that it willmaximize the expected utility of final consumption. Pursuing this method bybackward induction, we obtain the full description of the optimal nonmyopicportfolio strategy, which is given by the set of functions $\left\{X_{it}(X_{t-1})\mid i=1,...,N;\quad t=1,...,T\right\} ,$ with $%X_{iT}(X)=C_{iT}(X)$.The question is to determine the impact of index $t$ on the optimalportfolio composition $(X_{1t}(X),...,X_{Nt}(X))$ for a given wealth $X$accumulated at the beginning of the period. To illustrate, let us limit theanalysis to the comparison between the optimal portfolio composition inperiods $T-1$ and $T$, assuming the same $X=X_{T-2}=X_{T-1}$. We see thatthe only difference between these two decision problems (\ref{VT-1}) and (%\ref{VT-2}) comes from the replacement of the original utility function $u$on retirement consumption by the value function $V_{T-1}$ on the accumulatedwealth \ at the end of the period. We know that this is the case if and onlyif the degree of concavity of $V_{T-1}$ is comparable to the degree ofconcavity of $u$ in the sense of Arrow-Pratt. Thus, we need to evaluate thedegree of concavity of $V_{T-1}$.\ This is done as follows.\ At the lastperiod, the optimal portfolio composition is characterized by $C_{iT}(X)$that is the solution of \begin{equation}u^{\prime }(C_{iT}(X))=\xi (X)\pi _{i}\end{equation}subject to the budget constraint $\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}C_{iT}(X)=X.$\ Fullydifferentiating this condition with respect to $X$ and eliminating $\pi _{i}$yields \begin{equation}C_{iT}^{\prime }(X)=\dfrac{-\xi ^{\prime }(X)}{\xi (X)}\tau (C_{iT}(X)),\label{8}\end{equation}where $\tau (C)=-u^{\prime }(C)/u^{\prime \prime }(C)=\left[ A(C)\right]^{-1}$ is the degree of absolute risk tolerance of the agent. From thebudget constraint, we have that $\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}C_{iT}^{\prime }(X)=1$%.\ Using (\ref{8}), it implies that \begin{equation}\dfrac{-\xi ^{\prime }(X)}{\xi (X)}=\left[ \sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}\tau(C_{iT}(X))\right] ^{-1}.\end{equation}On the other side, we know from the standard Lagrangian method that $%V_{T-1}^{\prime }(X)=\xi (X).$ It implies that \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V_{T-1}^{\prime }(X)}{V_{T-1}^{\prime \prime }(X)}=\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi_{i}\tau (C_{iT}(X)).  \label{Wilson}\end{equation}The left-hand side of this equation is the weighted expectation of theabsolute risk tolerance evaluated at the random final wealth. It is anexpectation under the assumption that $\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}=1$, which meansthat the risk free rate is zero. Condition (\ref{Wilson}) means that therelative risk tolerance of the value function used to measure the optimalattitude toward portfolio risk at $T-1$ is a weighted average of ex postabsolute risk tolerance. This result has first been obtained by Wilson(1968) in the context of static risk sharing. Suppose that function $\tau $be convex.\ By the Jensen's inequality, we then obtain that \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V_{T-1}^{\prime }(X)}{V_{T-1}^{\prime \prime }(X)}\geq \tau \left(\sum_{i}p_{i}\pi _{i}C_{iT}(X)\right) =\tau (X)=\dfrac{-u^{\prime }(X)}{%u^{\prime \prime }(X)}.\end{equation}Because this is true for any $X$, $V_{T-1}$ is less concave than $u$ in thesense of Arrow-Pratt. We conclude that {\it the convexity of absolute risktolerance is necessary and sufficient for younger people to take moreportfolio risk, }ceteris paribus. By symmetry, the concavity of absoluterisk tolerance is necessary and sufficient for younger people to take lessportfolio risk. This result has first been obtained by Gollier andZeckhauser (1998) who extended this result to the more difficult case ofincomplete markets.The limit case is when absolute risk tolerance is linear, which correspondsto the set of HARA utility functions. For HARA preferences, the age of theinvestor has no effect on the optimal composition of her portfolio. Becausethis set of functions contains the only one for which a complete analyticalsolution for the optimal portfolio strategies can be obtained, it is not asurprise that most economist specialized in this field recommend aage-independent portfolio strategy. It must be stressed however that thereis no strong argument in favor of HARA functions, except for theirsimplicity. Whether absolute risk tolerance is concave or convex, or neitherof the two, remains an open question for empirical investigation. Guiso,Jappelli and Terlizesse (1995) observed a bell curve for the relationshipbetween age and the share of wealth invested in stocks, suggesting that $%\tau $ is neither concave nor convex.We did not take into account of an important phenomenon in this analysis.\Namely, younger people usually face a larger background risk on their humancapital. As we grow older, the uncertainty on one's human capital isrevealed by labour markets. From our discussion in section \ref{RVsec}, itis likely to imply a tempering effect on the optimal demand for stocks.\section{Self-insurance and time diversification\label{self}}Up to now, we assumed that  households have no control on what they put inand out of the fund of assets at each period. In other words, we assumedthat the capital is accumulated for a single objective, which is consumptionat old age. Obviously, this is not a reasonable assumption.\ Most householdsalso use savings for a precautionary motive.\ They increase their saving incase of an unexpected transitory increase in income, and they reduce theirsaving effort, or even they become borrowers, in case of an adversetransitory shock on their incomes. Reciprocally, agents can decide to reducetheir saving effort if their have been lucky on their portfolio. This meansthat agents can smooth shocks on their accumulated wealth by increasing orreducing their consumption over several periods. As we will see, consumptionsmoothing plays the role of self-insurance.\ That implies in turn more risktaking.The simplest model that we could imagine for self-insurance over time is amodel in which  agents live for $N$ periods $t=1,...,N$. They have acash-on-hand $K$ prior to period $1$. At each period, they receive anon-capital income $W$. They consume $C_{t}$ from it in period $t$. Theremaining is saved in a risk free asset whose gross return is $R$. Agentsare allowed to take risk prior to period $1$, but they are prohibited to doso afterwards. This simplified assumption is made here because we want toisolate the self-insurance effect of time. We will come back to this pointlater on.Let $\widetilde{\varepsilon }$ denote the net payoff of the risk taken priorto period $1$. In period $1$, the discounted wealth $X$ will be the sum ofthe cash-on-hand, the discounted value of future incomes and the actualpayoff \ of the lottery: $X=K+$ $\sum_{t}R^{-t}W+\varepsilon $. Given $X,$agents select the consumption plan that maximizes their discounted lifetimeutility $V(X)$, which takes the following form: \begin{equation}V(X)=\max_{C_{1},...,C_{N}}\quad \sum_{t=1}^{N}\beta ^{t}u(C_{t})\label{inter}\end{equation}\begin{equation}s.t.\quad \sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}C_{t}=X,\end{equation}where $\beta $ is the discount factor on utility. It yields an optimalconsumption plan $C_{t}(X)$ which is a function of the discounted wealth ofthe agent. To solve this problem, we can use the fact that it is equivalentto program (\ref{1}) with $p_{t}=\beta ^{t}$ and $\pi _{t}=(R\beta )^{-t}$.\>From equation (\ref{Wilson}), we directly infer that \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V^{\prime }(X)}{V^{\prime \prime }(X)}=\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\tau(C_{t}(X)).  \label{w2}\end{equation}Condition (\ref{w2}) characterizes the degree of tolerance towards the risk $%\widetilde{\varepsilon }$ taken prior to period $1$. The simplest case isobtained when $\beta =R$.\ In that case, we know that it is optimal tosmooth consumption perfectly.\ It yields \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V^{\prime }(X)}{V^{\prime \prime }(X)}=\left[ \sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}%\right] \tau \left( \dfrac{X}{\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}\right) =\left[\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\right] \tau \left( W+\dfrac{K+\varepsilon }{%\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}\right)  \label{w3}\end{equation}when the risk free rate is small. Now, compare {\it two agents whose wealthlevels per period (}$X/\sum R^{-t}${\it ) are the same}.\ But one of the twoagents has one period to go ($N=1$), whereas the other agent has $N>1$periods to go. Equation (\ref{w3}) tells us that the agent with time horizon $N$ will be $\sum R^{-t}\approx N$ times more risk tolerant than the agentwith only one period to go. Thus, we conclude that there is a strong timediversification effect which takes place in this model. The intuition isquite simple.\ Each dollar of loss or gain will be equally split into $1/N$of a dollar reduction or increase in the consumption in each period. This isan efficient risk-sharing scheme of the different future selves representingthe household over time.\ This ability to diversify the single risk overtime induces the agent to be more willing to purchase it.Our ceteris paribus assumption above was that agents have the same wealthlevel per period.\ This means that a reduction in the time horizon does notaffect the feasible consumption level per period. This is the case forexample when the agent has no cash-on-hand in period 1 in such a way thatwealth $X$ comes solely from discounting future incomes.\ We canalternatively compare two agents with different time horizons, but withidentical discounted wealth $X$. In this case, the agent with a longer timehorizon will consume less at each period. Under DARA, that will induce morerisk aversion, and it is not clear which of the time diversification effectand this wealth effect will dominate. The limit case is when absolute risktolerance is homogenous of degree 1 with respect to consumption.\ This isthe case under CRRA, since we have $\tau (C)=C/\gamma $. Equation (\ref{w3})is rewritten as $-V^{\prime }(X)/V^{\prime \prime }(X)=X/\gamma $ in thatcase. This is independent of the time horizon. Under CRRA, the wealth effectjust compensates the time diversification effect: two CRRA agents with thesame aggregate wealth but facing different time horizons will have the sameattitude towards the single risk $\widetilde{\varepsilon }$. When absoluterisk tolerance is subhomogeneous., the agent will be more tolerant to asingle risk if it is resolved earlier in his life.Remember that equation (\ref{w3}) holds only under the assumption that aconstant consumption over the lifetime is optimal, i.e., when $R\beta =1$.When $R$ and $\beta ^{-1}$ are not equal, we must use equation (\ref{w2})with the optimal consumption plan ( $C_{1},...,C_{N})$.\ If absolute risktolerance is convex, Jensen's inequality applied to this equation impliesthat \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V^{\prime }(X)}{V^{\prime \prime }(X)}\geq \left[\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\right] \tau \left( \dfrac{\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}C_{t}}{%\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}\right) =\left[ \sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\right] \tau \left( \dfrac{X}{\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}\right) .  \label{w4}\end{equation}This is equation (\ref{w3}), except that the equality has been replaced byan inequality. Thus, under convex absolute risk tolerance, the timediversification effect is even stronger than explained above. \ Technically,this result has been obtained by following the same procedure than  the onefor the complementarity of repeated risks in section \ref{repeated}. Here,the optimal fluctuations of consumption over time, rather than acrossstates, are complementary to risk taking if $\tau $ is convex.The model presented in this section is not realistic because of theassumption that there is a single risk in the lifetime of the investor. Wenow combine the different effects of time horizon on the optimalinstantaneous portfolio:\begin{enumerate}\item  The {\it complementarity effect} of repeated risks over time: theoption to take risk in the future raises the willingness to take risk todayunder convex absolute risk tolerance;\item  The {\it time diversification effect}: the opportunity to smoothshocks on capital by small variations of consumption over long horizonsraises the willingness to take risk;\item  The {\it wealth effect}: for a given discounted wealth, a longerhorizon means less consumption at each period, which reduces the willingnessto take risk under DARA.\end{enumerate}We consider the following model.\ Investors can consume, save and take riskat each period from $t=1$ to $t=T$. At each period, there is someuncertainty about which state of the world $i=1,...,N$ will prevail at theend of the period. Within each period $t$, the agent begins with theselection of a portfolio.\ After observing the state of the world and thevalue $X_{t}$ of the portfolio, the agent decides how much to consume $(C_{t}$) and how much to save for the next period ($S_{t}$).\ We can decompose theabove-mentioned effects by using backward induction again.\ This is done inthe following steps:\begin{itemize}\item  In period $T$, the agent selects his optimal portfolio ofArrow-Debreu securities by solving program (\ref{VT-1}), where $X_{T-1}$ isreplaced by $S_{T-1}$. The transformation from $u$ to $V_{T-1}$ describesthe complementarity (or substituability)  effect of repeated risk.\item  At the end of period $T-1$, after observing the state of the worldand the associated value $X_{T-1}$ of the portfolio, the agent solves hisconsumption-saving problem which is written as \begin{equation}\widehat{V}_{T-1}(X_{T-1})=\max_{C}\quad u(C)+\beta V_{T-1}(R(X_{T-1}-C)).\label{9}\end{equation}This operation describes the time diversification effect and the wealtheffect of time horizon.\item  The agent determines the optimal composition of his portfolio at thebeginning of period $T-1$ by solving program (\ref{VT-2}), but with function $V_{T-1}$ being replaced by function $\widehat{V}_{T-1}$ defined by (\ref{9}%) to take into account of the possibility to smooth consumption over time.\end{itemize}Going back to the original question of how does time horizon affect theoptimal structure of households' portfolios, we must compare the degree ofconcavity of $\widehat{V}_{T-1}$ with respect to the degree of concavity of $%u$. If \ $\widehat{V}_{T-1}$ is less concave than $u$, it would imply that,ceteris paribus, one selects a riskier portfolio in period $T-1$ than inperiod $T$. \ The CRRA function is an instructive benchmark. Because CRRA isa special case of HARA, we know from section \ref{repeated} that $%V_{T-1}(.)\equiv hu(.)$: the option to invest in risky assets in period $T$does not affect the degree of concavity of \ the value function.\ It impliesthat program (\ref{9}) is a special case of program (\ref{inter}) with $%\beta $ being replaced by $\beta h$. Because $u$ is CRRA, we also know thatthe time diversification effect is completely offset by the wealth effect,so that $\widehat{V}_{T-1}(.)\equiv \widehat{h}u(.)$: \ $\widehat{V}_{T-1}$as the same concavity than $u$. We conclude that myopia is optimal underCRRA. The optimal dynamic portfolio strategy is obtained by doing as if eachperiod would be the last one before retirement. There is no effect of timehorizon on the optimal portfolio, ceteris paribus.\ This result was alreadyin Merton (1969) and Samuelson (1969).\ Mossin (1969) showed that CRRA isalso necessary for optimal myopia.\ It is easy to combine our other results.\ For example, a larger time horizoninduces riskier portfolios if absolute risk tolerance is convex andsubhomogeneous. On the contrary, a larger time horizon induces moreconservative portfolios if absolute risk tolerance is concave andsuperhomogeneous.\section{The liquidity constraint}In the previous sections, we assumed that markets are frictionless.\ Thereare no transaction costs to exchange assets and no cap on the risk that canbe taken on financial markets. Moreover, we assumed that the borrowing rateis equal to the lending rate on the credit market.\ Whereas the effect ofthe introduction of market imperfections on the optimal portfolio is easy toexamine in a static model, the analysis becomes complex in a dynamicframework. In this section, we will focus on the effect of a liquidityconstraint on the optimal portfolio. A liquidity constraint is an extremeform of inefficiency on the credit market.\ It forces households to maintaina sufficient level of cash-on-hand in each period. In other words, itprohibits households to borrow too much.\ A weaker version of the liquidityconstraint is when the borrowing rate is larger than the lending rate.The effect of \ a liquidity constraint on the optimal portfolio is easy tounderstand. Remember that it is optimal for households to smooth adverseshocks on their portfolio return by reducing consumption over a long periodof time. This is done by reducing saving immediately after the adverse shockto finance short term consumption. This is the mechanism behind consumptionsmoothing.\ If the shock is large enough, it can be the case that somehouseholds become short of cash, i.e. that they become net borrowers for ashort period of time. Under the liquidity constraint, this is not allowed.Thus, these households will be forced to drastically reduce their short termconsumption. They will not be able to time diversify their portfolio riskanymore.\ This will raise their degree of aversion towards portfolio risk.The simplest model to describe this phenomenon is similar to the onepresented in section \ref{self}.\ We assume that households live for $N$periods, and that they start with a cash-on-hand $K$.\ The only possibilityto take risk is at the beginning of period $t=1$. Households have apermanent income $W.\;$\ They must maintain a positive cash-on-handpermanently.\ We also assume that $R\beta =1$.\ We showed above how thissimplest model can be extended by the introduction of repeated risk takingand $R\beta \neq 1$.Let $\varepsilon $ denote the payoff of the risk taken at the beginning ofperiod $1$. Thus, when households determine their optimal consumption plan ,they are endowed with a cash-on-hand $K+\varepsilon $. Because perfectconsumption smoothing is optimal in the absence of the liquidity constraint,households would consume \begin{equation}C=W+\dfrac{K+\varepsilon }{\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}\end{equation}at each period. It yields a degree of risk aversion to risk $\widetilde{%\varepsilon }$ ex ante that is given by equation (\ref{w3}). How is thedegree of aversion to risk $\widetilde{\varepsilon }$ affected by theconstraint that the cash-on-hand must be positive? In the unconstrainedcase, the cash-on-hand at the end of the first period would be \begin{equation}K+\varepsilon +W-C=(K+\varepsilon )\dfrac{-1+\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}{%\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}.\end{equation}If $\varepsilon $ is larger than $K$, the constraint will not be binding andthe local measure of concavity of the value function $V$ , measured at $%X=K+\varepsilon +W\sum_{t}R^{-t}$, will be as in equation (\ref{w3}).\ Ofcourse, the difference is for the local measure of the value function atlower wealth levels, where the liquidity constraint is binding. Indeed, when $\varepsilon <-K$, households would like to finance short term consumptionby borrowing money, but they are not allowed to do so.\ They are forced toswallow the drop in their wealth in one shot by reducing their immediateconsumption accordingly.\ They \ will consume $W$ afterwards. For thosevalues of $\varepsilon $, we obtain that \begin{equation}\dfrac{-V^{\prime }(X)}{V^{\prime \prime }(X)}=\tau (W+K+\varepsilon ).\end{equation}Under DARA, we have that \begin{equation}\tau (W+K+\varepsilon )\leq \tau (W+\dfrac{K+\varepsilon }{%\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}})\leq \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\right] \tau (W+\dfrac{%K+\varepsilon }{\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}}).\end{equation}This means that the local degree of concavity of the value function issmaller with a binding liquidity constraint than without it.\ Moreover, itis reduced by a factor at least equal to $\sum_{t=1}^{N}R^{-t}\approx N$ .There is no more time diversification.The implication of this analysis is that households that are more likely tobe liquidity constrained will adopt a more conservative portfolio strategy.\section{Conclusion}The theory of dynamic portfolio management remains a fascinating field ofresearch.\ The similarity between the static portfolio problem underuncertainty and the dynamic consumption problem under certainty is helpfulto understand how risk and time interact with each other to generate adynamically optimal portfolio strategy. We have shown in particular that theconcavity or convexity of the absolute risk tolerance with respect toconsumption is important to characterize the effect of time on risk taking.\This is because the absolute tolerance to portfolio risk in the staticportfolio problem is a weighted average of ex post absolute risk toleranceson consumption.\ Similarly, the absolute risk tolerance on wealth in thedynamic consumption problem under certainty is equal to the discounted valueof future absolute risk tolerances on consumption. Thus, absolute risktolerances can be summed, contrary to  absolute risk aversions.This very basic result is at the origin of our understanding of how portfolio risks occurring at different points in time interact with eachother.\ We also showed how the familiar notion of time diversification canbe justified on a theoretical ground. We presented several testablehypotheses using data on household portfolios:\begin{enumerate}\item  Wealthier people own more risky assets (under decreasing absoluterisk aversion);\item  Wealthier people invest a larger share of their wealth in riskyassets (under \ decreasing relative risk aversion);\item  Households with a riskier human capital invest less in risky assets(under risk vulnerability);\item  Households who can invest longer in risky assets will invest more inthem (under convex absolute risk tolerance);\item  Households who are more likely to be liquidity constraint in thefuture will invest less in risky assets (under decreasing absolute riskaversion).\end{enumerate}Empirical evidences related to these hypotheses are presented in variouschapters of this book. \newpage \begin{center}{\bf Bibliography}\end{center}\vspace{.30cm}\begin{verse}Arrow, K.
