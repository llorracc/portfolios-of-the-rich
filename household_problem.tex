We assume that with probability $(1-p_{s})$ stock returns will be distributed lognormally with a mean that yields an equity premium so that $\overline{R}_{s} = E_{t} [R_{s,t+1}] = 1.06$ or 4 percent in excess of the return available on the safe asset and a standard deviation $\sigma_{s} = .2$ which is approximately equal to the annual standard deviation of returns on the S\&P 500 in the postwar period.  With probability $p_{s}$ there is a stock market `crash' in which the gross return is $R_{s,t+1}= .1$.  This is meant to capture the experience of the Great Depression in the U.S., when the value of the S\&P 500 fell by about 90 percent from its 1929 peak to its 1933 trough, and more broadly to capture the empirical fact that stock returns are not quite lognormally distributed but instead exhibit `fat tails.'  In combination with the presence of a small chance of unemployment spells, this assumption is sufficient to prevent consumers from holding all of their assets in stocks, which they otherwise would do. (The fact that for more traditional parameterizations consumers will hold 100 percent of their portfolio in stocks is called the `portfolio structure puzzle'; it is the microeconomic manifestation of the equity premium puzzle.  In contrast, under our combination of assumptions, consumers avoid putting 100 percent of their portfolio in stocks because of the small risk that labor income and the stock porfolio could both fall to nearly zero at the same time, driving the marginal utility of consumption to infinity.)Some consumers can invest a positive share of their portfolio $0 < w_{k,t} \leq 1$ in an entrepreneurial project.  In order to capture in the simplest possible way the higher return on self-financed projects emphasized by Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} and Hubbard and Gentry~\cite{gentry&hubbard:wealthysave}, the gross return on the entreprenurial project $R_{k,t}$ is scaled by a monotonically increasing function $\psi(w_{k,t})$ such that $\psi(1)=1$; that is, one can only reap the highest possible return on an entreprenurial project by investing one's entire net worth in that project.  The simplest choice of functional form for $\psi$ would be linear, but for technical reasons it is more convenient to assume that $\psi$ is quadratic (and concave).\footnote{Because $\psi'(w_{k,t})$ appears in the first order condition, assuming that $\psi$ is quadratic helps to guarantee that there will be a uniquely optimal portfolio share choice for $w_{k,t}$.}It is difficult to know how to parameterize the rate of return for the entrepreneurial project.  Because entrepreneurial investment is undoubtedly riskier than stock market investment, it is clear that we should assume some `entrepreneurial premium,' $E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]>E_{t}[R_{s,t+1}]$.  Our baseline assumption is that $\overline{R}_{k} = E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]=1.16$ or $0.10$ higher than the expected return on stocks, and that the stochastic distribution of rates of return around $\overline{R}_{k}$ mimics the distribution of the rate of return on stocks except that there is a much larger probability of entrepreneurial `failure' (in which $R_{k,t+1}=0$) than there is of a stock market crash (in which $R_{s,t+1}=.1$).  Specifically, our baseline assumption is that the probability of `bankruptcy' of the entreprenurial project is $p_{k}=.1$ annually.\footnote{Quadrini~\cite{quadrini:entrepreneurship} provides evidence that the rate of failure for entrepreneurs who have been self-employed for three years or longer is $.1$ annually.  The failure rate in the first two years of entrepreneurial activity is much greater, but the additional modelling complication and solution time required to capture this phenomenon did not seem worth the payoff of greater realism.}To complete the specification of our treatment of entrepreneurial investment, we assume that $\lim_{w_{k}\rightarrow 0} \psi(w_{k}) = R/ E_{t}[R_{k,t+1}]$; that is, if the consumer were to invest an infinitesimal amount in the entrepreneurial project, the expected rate of return would be $R$, the riskfree return, but the project would still bear the large {\it ex ante} risks associated with entrepreneurial ventures.Not all households are allowed to pursue an entrepreneurial project in every period.  Any household that pursued an entrepreneurial project in period $t-1$ is eligible to continue that entrepreneurial activity.  But period $t-1$ nonentrepreneurs are permitted to invest in an entrepreneurial project in period $t$ only if they are lucky enough to obtain a new  `idea,' an event that occurs with probability $\overline{n}$ in each period.  (Formally, $\tilde{n} \sim u[0,1]$ and one obtains an idea if $\tilde{n} \leq \overline{n}$).  If a consumer who is currently engaged in an entrepreneurial activity decides to invest none of his portfolio in the project in this period, then that consumer cannot resume the project next period; he joins the pool of `nonentrepreneurs' and must await the next random draw of an entrepreneurial `idea.'  The variable $Q_{t} \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether the consumer is eligible to pursue an entrepreneurial idea.For technical reasons the best way to specify the portfolio allocation problem is to have consumers first decide how much of their total wealth to invest in the entrepreneurial project, and then decide how to allocate the remaining non-entrepreneurial wealth between the riskless asset and stocks.  Mathematically, $w_{k,t}$ of the entire portfolio is invested in the entrepreneurial project, leaving $(1-w_{k,t})$ to allocate between riskless and risky investment, with $w_{s,t}$ designating the portion of this remainder allocated to stocks.To summarize, the rate of return earned by a consumer who saves anypositive amount $S_{t}$ in period $t$ is given by $R_{t+1}$ where:\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t}-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t+1} 	\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray*}\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowTrueEqns}}{The actual solution method, however, assumes the problem is solved intwo stages: first, make a choice about the entrepreneurial share $w_{k,t}$,then decide the percentage of the nonentrepreneurial share to invest instocks.  In this case the equation for $R_{t+1}$ is:\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t})(1-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}(1-w_{k,t})w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t+1} 	\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray*}}Finally, we assume that running an entrepreneurial project consumes a minimum amount of time $\tau>0$ and thus reduces the amount of wage income the entrepreneur earns to $Y_{t+1}(1-\tau)$; our baseline assumption is $\tau=.1$.  This assumption is necessary to prevent consumers who have ever received an entrepreneurial idea from keeping the entreprenurial project `alive' by investing an infinitesimal amount in the project in every period.  Such a strategy would preserve the option value inherent in the entrepreneurial project at an arbitrarily small cost; requiring some minimum fixed commitment of time imposes a lower bound on the cost of keeping the entrepreneurial option alive.\subsubsection{Utility}The consumer derives utility from two sources: the ongoing utility from consumption obtained from the CRRA utility function $u(c) = c^{1-\rho}/(1-\rho)$, and the utility derived from the contemplation of the future bequest to be left.  The bequest utility function is of the form\begin{eqnarray*}	B(S) & = & \frac{(S+\lambda)^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha} \\\end{eqnarray*}where the parameter restriction $\alpha<\rho$ is imposed because it implies that bequests are a luxury good, and $\lambda>0$ is imposed because it implies that there will be some level of permanent income below which the bequest motive will be inoperative (the desired bequest would be negative, which is ruled out).\subsubsection{Bellman's Equation}Bellman's equation for this problem is:\begin{eqnarray}	V_{t}(X_{t},P_{t},Q_{t}) & =& \max_{\{C_{t},w_{s,t},w_{k,t}\}} 	u(C_{t}) + \beta E_{t}\left[(1-d_{t}) 	V_{t+1}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})+ d_{t}B(S_{t}) \right] \nonumber\\ 	 & \mbox{such that} &   	\label{eq:bellmanraw}  \\	S_{t}   & = & X_{t}-C_{t} \nonumber \\	X_{t+1} & = & R_{t+1}S_{t} + Y_{t+1}(1-\tau(w_{k,t}>0)) \nonumber \\	Y_{t+1} & = & P_{t+1}\epsilon_{t+1} \nonumber \\	P_{t+1} & = & G_{t} P_{t} \eta_{t+1} \nonumber \\	R_{t+1} & = & 	R(1-w_{k,t}-w_{s,t}) + 	R_{s,t+1}w_{s,t} + R_{k,t+1}Q_{t}\psi(w_{k,t})w_{k,t} \nonumber \end{eqnarray}and\begin{equation}Q_{t+1} = \begin{cases}   1 & \text{if $w_{k,t} > 0$ and $Q_{t} = 1$}\\ 1 & \text{if $w_{k,t} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} < \overline{n}$}\\ 0 & \text{if $w_{k,t} = 0$ and $\tilde{n} \geq \overline{n}$}.\end{cases} \nonumber \end{equation}\section{Solution Procedure}Define the function\begin{equation*}\Omega_{t}(S_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},w_{k,t},w_{s,t}) = E_{t}\left[(1-d_{t}) V_{t+1}(R_{t+1} S_{t}+Y_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})+ d_{t}B(S_{t})\right]\end{equation*}which expresses the expected value as of the end of period $t$ of having chosen the indicated values of the choice variables $S_{t},w_{k,t},w_{s,t}$ given the indicated values of the states $P_{t},Q_{t}$.Now define the value function associated with the optimal stock investment share, given the share chosen for the entrepreneurial project:\begin{equation}{\overline{\Omega}_{t}}(S_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},w_{k,t}) = \max_{\{w_{s,t}\}} \Omega_{t}(S_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},w_{k,t},w_{s,t}) \label{eq:FOCwrtomegak}\end{equation}Assuming there is an optimum for $w_{s,t}$ in the range $0 < w_{s,t} < 1$, and denoting the derivative of $\Omega_{t}$ with respect to $w_{s,t}$ as $\overline{\Omega}^{s}_{t}$, that optimum will be characterized by the FOC:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & \overline{\Omega}^{s}_{t}(S_{t},P_{t},Q_{t},w_{k,t})  \\	0 & = & \beta E_{t}\left[ \frac{\partial X_{t+1}}{\partial 	w_{s,t}} \left( (1-d_{t})	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right) \right]\\	0 & = & \beta E_{t} \left[(R_{s,t+1} - R)(S_{t}) \left((1-d_{t}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right)\right].\end{eqnarray*}\ifthenelse{\boolean{ShowTrueEqns}}{or the program version \begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & \beta E_{t} \left[(R_{s,t+1} - R)(1-w_{k,t})(S_{t}) \left((1-d_{t}) 	V_{t+1}^{x}(X_{t+1},P_{t+1},Q_{t+1})\right)\right].\end{eqnarray*}}Call the value of $w_{s,t}$ which satisfies the FOC $\hat{w}_{s,t}$. If the expected value function as a function of returns is concave and single-peaked, the FOC will identify the optimum portfolio share, even if that share is outside the permissible range $0 \leq w_{s,t} \leq 1$.  Furthermore, if $\hat{w}_{s,t}$ is outside the permissible range, whichever of $\{0,1\}$ is closest to $\hat{w}_{s,t}$ will be the optimal feasible choice of $w_{s,t}$.

Recall that for lognormally distributed variables we know that\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t} [\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] & = & E_{t}[ \log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] + \frac{1}{2} 	\text{var}_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] \\	 & = & r_s + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}and so the overall return on the portfolio will be\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & = & (1-w) R + w \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}  \\	R_{t+1} & = & (1-w) r + w \tilde{r}_{s,t+1} \\\end{eqnarray*}which can be approximated by\footnote{To see this, note that $\log R^{1-w}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w} = (1-w)\log R + w \log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ and recall that $\log R \approx r$, $\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1} \approx \tilde{r}_{s,t+1}$, and $\log R_{t+1} \approx R_{t+1}.$}\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & \approx & R^{1-w}\tilde{R}^{w}_{t+1}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The value-function-maximizing choice of $w$ will be the choice that minimizes $\gamma$ (recall that $W^{1-\alpha}/(1-\alpha)<0$) which will therefore be the $w$ that minimizes $E_{t}[ R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$.\begin{eqnarray*}	E_{t}[ R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}] & = & 	E_{t}[R^{(1-w)(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & R^{(1-w)(1-\alpha)}E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}]  \\\end{eqnarray*}But because $\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ is distributed lognormally \begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}] & = & E_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}] + \frac{1}{2}\text{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & w(1-\alpha) E_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{s,t+1}] + 	 \frac{[w(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\text{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}]  \\	 & = & w(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[w(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}   \\\end{eqnarray*}Note that the choice of $w$ that minimizes $E_{t}[R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$ will be identical with the choice that minimizes its log.  Thus the problem is to find the $w$ that minimizes\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]  & = & \log [R^{(1-w)(1-\alpha)} 	E_{t}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w(1-\alpha)}] \\    & = & (1-w)(1-\alpha) \log R + w(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[w(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}\\	 & = & (1-\alpha)r + w(1-\alpha) 	 (r_s-r) + \frac{[w(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The FOC is:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & (1-\alpha)(r_s-r) + 	[w(1-\alpha)](1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\	 & = & (r_s-r) + 	[w(1-\alpha)]\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  \\	w & = & 	\frac{-(r_s-r)}{(1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}}  \\	w & = & 	\frac{(r_s-r)}{(\alpha-1)\sigma_{r_s}^{2}}  \\\end{eqnarray*}If $\alpha>1$ then this expression has the intuitive implications that the share of the portfolio devoted to risky assets increases with the equity premium and decreases as consumers get more risk averse ($\alpha$ rises) or as the riskiness of the risky asset increases ($\sigma_{r_s}^{2}$ rises).  For moderate values of $\alpha$ like 3 and for reasonable values of the variance of lognormally distributed returns $\sigma_{r_s}^{2}$ this equation implies a value of $w>1$.  That is, consumers borrow at the riskless rate in order to invest in the risky asset.  For example, suppose that the equity premium $r_s-r = .05$ and suppose that the standard deviation of annual stock returns is $\sigma_{r_s} = .15$ implying $\sigma_{r_s}^{2} = .0225$.  Then for $\alpha=3$ this equation yields $w = -.05/(-2*.0225) = 1.111\ldots$; that is, over 100 percent of the portfolio is placed in the risky asset.\subsection{Portfolio Choice Between a Safe and Two Risky Assets}\begin{eqnarray*}	R_{t+1} & \approx & R^{(1-w_{s}-w_{k})}\tilde{R}^{w_{s}}_{t+1}\tilde{R}^{w_{k}}_{t+1}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The value-function-maximizing choice of $(w_{s},w_{k})$ will be the choices that minimize $E_{t}[ R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$.\begin{eqnarray*}	E_{t}[ R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}] & = & 	E_{t}[R^{(1-w_{s}-w_{k})(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{w_{k}(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & R^{(1-w_{s}-w_{k})(1-\alpha)}     E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{w_{k}(1-\alpha)}]  \\\end{eqnarray*}If we assume that $\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}$ and $\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}$ are distributed lognormally and independently of each other, we have\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{w_{i}(1-\alpha)}] & = & E_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{w_{i}(1-\alpha)}] + \frac{1}{2}\text{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}^{w_{i}(1-\alpha)}]  \\	 & = & w_{i}(1-\alpha) E_{t}[\log \tilde{R}_{i,t+1}] + 	 \frac{[w_{i}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\text{var}_{t}[\log 	\tilde{R}_{i,t+1}]  \\	 & = & w_{i}(1-\alpha) r_s + 	 \frac{[w_{i}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_i}^{2}   \\\end{eqnarray*}for $i \in \{s,k\}$.Note that the combination of $(w_{s},w_{k})$ that minimizes $E_{t}[R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}]$ will be identical with the choice that minimizes its log.  Thus the problem is to find the $(w_{s},w_{k})$ that minimize\begin{eqnarray*}	\log E_{t}[R_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}] & = & \log [R^{(1-w_{s}-w_{k})(1-\alpha)} 	E_{t}[\tilde{R}_{s,t+1}^{w_{s}(1-\alpha)}\tilde{R}_{k,t+1}^{w_{k}(1-\alpha)}] \\	 & = & (1-\alpha)r 	 + w_{s}(1-\alpha) (r_s-r) + \frac{[w_{s}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_s}^{2}  	 + w_{k}(1-\alpha) (r_k-r) + \frac{[w_{k}(1-\alpha)]^{2}}{2}\sigma_{r_k}^{2}  \\\end{eqnarray*}The FOC with respect to $w_{i}$ for $i \in \{s,k\}$ is:\begin{eqnarray*}	0 & = & (1-\alpha)(r_i-r) + 	[w_{i}(1-\alpha)](1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}  \\	 & = & (r_i-r) + [w_{i}(1-\alpha)]\sigma_{r_i}^{2}  \\	w_{i} & = & \frac{-(r_i-r)}{(1-\alpha)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}}  \\	w_{i} & = & \frac{(r_i-r)}{(\alpha-1)\sigma_{r_i}^{2}}  \\\end{eqnarray*}This formula provides a useful way to parameterize the problem, because as $S \rightarrow \infty$ the consumers in our model in the limit derive all of their utility from wealth, so we should expect their behavior in the limit to resemble that of agents like those defined in equation ($\ref{eq:wealthutil}$).  If we observe values for $w_{r_{s}}$ and $\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}$ we can calculate the value of $\alpha$ which would be consistent with those observations:\begin{eqnarray*}	\alpha & = & 1 + \frac{r_{s}-r}{w_{s}\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}\end{eqnarray*}Consider first the rich households who are not engaged in entrepreneurial activity.  Averaging across our four datasets, the observed value of $w_{s}$ for these households is roughly 0.7.  Our baseline assumption about the process for the stock marketyields a value of $\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2} \approx .07$.  This yields an estimate of\begin{eqnarray*}	\alpha & = & 1 + \frac{.035}{0.7*.07} \\	 & = & 1.7\end{eqnarray*}If take the richest 1/2 percent of the consumers in our datasets as reflecting a close approximation to $S = \infty$, the appropriate sample values to match are roughly $w_{k} = .5$, $w_{s} = .25$.  This implies that we must make assumptions such that \begin{eqnarray*}	\frac{w_{s}}{w_{k}} & = & .5  \\	 & = & \frac{(r_{s}-r)/\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}{(r_{k}-r)/\sigma_{r_{k}}^{2}} \\	 & = & \left(\frac{r_{s}-r}{r_{k}-r}\right)\left(\frac{\sigma_{r_{k}}^{2}}{\sigma_{r_{s}}^{2}}\right)\end{eqnarray*}\end{document}Furthermore, casual scrutiny of the {\it Forbes 400} list reveals that most of the wealthiest people in the world made their wealth primarily or exclusively from one enterprise or a set of closely connected enterprises, so it seems reasonable to impose.Quadrini form:In each period there is some probability that a given household will have the opportunity to enter the business sector.

Thus the consumer learns the value of $\epsilon_{t}$, the transitory shock to labor income, $\eta_{t}$ the permanent shock to labor income, and the values for $R_{s,t}$, the gross return on stocks purchased in the previous period, and $R_{k,t}$, the gross return on the entrepreneurial project (if any) in which the household invested in the previous period.  We assume that the net return on the entrepreneurial project is given by $R_{k,t}Q_{t+1} \psi(w_{t-1}_{k})$ where $\psi$ is a function that scales down the return on the entrepreneurial project to an extent determined by the fraction of the household's portfolio that is invested in the project.  If the entire portfolio is invested in the project ($w_{t-1}_{k}=1$) then $\psi(1)=1$ and the household reaps the full return.  If a smaller fraction of the portfolio is invested, the return is proportionately lower.In order to start an entrepreneurial venture, a household who is not currently engaged in an entrepreneurial project must have an `idea,' an event that occurs randomly with probability $p=.05$ at the beginning of each year.  The household then must choose whether to implement the idea by investing a positive fraction of its portfolio in the entrepreneurial project, or to remain a worker.  We the presence or absence of The expected value of wealth that is not consumed in the present period is given by the discounted value if the consumer is alive in the next period (and event with probability $(1-d_{t})$ plus the value they attach to the bequest they will leave behind in the event of death.  Denote total household resources at the beginning of period $t$ by $X_{t}$, household noncapital income by $Y_{t}$, the rate of return on stocks as $R_{s,t}$ and the share of the household portfolio in stocks is designated $w_{s,t}$.

Roughly 40 percent of entrepreneurial projects fail in the first year, but the failure rate of projects which have survived for three years or longer is only about 10 percent.  We capture this phenomenon by making the stochastic rate of return on entreprenurial projects $R_{k,t+1}$ a function of $Q_{t}$.  For `new' projects there is a 40 percent chance that $R_{k,t+1} = 0$ while for `mature' projects the probability of failure is only 10 percent.
